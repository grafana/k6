# 9.12.1 (2025-08-11)
## üöÄ Highlights
In the last version (9.12.0) the client introduced bigger write and read buffer sized. The default value we set was 512KiB.
However, users reported that this is too big for most use cases and can lead to high memory usage.
In this version the default value is changed to 256KiB. The `README.md` was updated to reflect the
correct default value and include a note that the default value can be changed.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- fix(options): Add buffer sizes to failover. Update README ([#3468](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/pull/3468))

# Old Changelog
## Unreleased

### Changed

* `go-redis` won't skip span creation if the parent spans is not recording. ([#2980](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/2980))
  Users can use the OpenTelemetry sampler to control the sampling behavior.
  For instance, you can use the `ParentBased(NeverSample())` sampler from `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace` to keep
  a similar behavior (drop orphan spans) of `go-redis` as before.

## [9.0.2](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/compare/v9.0.1...v9.0.2) (2023-02-01)

### Features

* upgrade OpenTelemetry, use the new metrics API. ([#2410](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/2410)) ([e29e42c](https://github.com/redis/go-redis/commit/e29e42cde2755ab910d04185025dc43ce6f59c65))

## v9 2023-01-30

### Breaking

- Changed Pipelines to not be thread-safe any more.

### Added

- Added support for [RESP3](https://github.com/antirez/RESP3/blob/master/spec.md) protocol. It was
  contributed by @monkey92t who has done the majority of work in this release.
- Added `ContextTimeoutEnabled` option that controls whether the client respects context timeouts
  and deadlines. See
  [Redis Timeouts](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-debugging.html#timeouts) for details.
- Added `ParseClusterURL` to parse URLs into `ClusterOptions`, for example,
  `redis://user:password@localhost:6789?dial_timeout=3&read_timeout=6s&addr=localhost:6790&addr=localhost:6791`.
- Added metrics instrumentation using `redisotel.IstrumentMetrics`. See
  [documentation](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-monitoring.html)
- Added `redis.HasErrorPrefix` to help working with errors.

### Changed

- Removed asynchronous cancellation based on the context timeout. It was racy in v8 and is
  completely gone in v9.
- Reworked hook interface and added `DialHook`.
- Replaced `redisotel.NewTracingHook` with `redisotel.InstrumentTracing`. See
  [example](example/otel) and
  [documentation](https://redis.uptrace.dev/guide/go-redis-monitoring.html).
- Replaced `*redis.Z` with `redis.Z` since it is small enough to be passed as value without making
  an allocation.
- Renamed the option `MaxConnAge` to `ConnMaxLifetime`.
- Renamed the option `IdleTimeout` to `ConnMaxIdleTime`.
- Removed connection reaper in favor of `MaxIdleConns`.
- Removed `WithContext` since `context.Context` can be passed directly as an arg.
- Removed `Pipeline.Close` since there is no real need to explicitly manage pipeline resources and
  it can be safely reused via `sync.Pool` etc. `Pipeline.Discard` is still available if you want to
  reset commands for some reason.

### Fixed

- Improved and fixed pipeline retries.
- As usually, added support for more commands and fixed some bugs.
