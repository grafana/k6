k6 v0.32.0 is here! :tada: It's a smaller release, featuring mostly chores that we never got to or that needed to be done in this release cycle, but does also includes a significant performance improvement for arrival-rate executors and some breaking changes.

## Move out of Bintray

Bintray has [stopped servicing users on 1st of May](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/), which meant that we needed to move the deb and rpm repositories out of there before then. Please follow the new [installation instructions](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) and the "Note about Bintray" to find out how to remove the old repository if you have used them.

## Notable changes

### Rewrite all collectors to new Output interface introduced in v0.31.0 and other related changes

We started on this in the previous v0.31.0 release and now all internal outputs implement the new `Output` interface we provided for [xk6 output extensions](https://github.com/k6io/k6/blob/master/release%20notes/v0.31.0.md#output-cleanup-and-extensions-1874). Additionally one of the old built-in outputs is being deprecated and one renamed:

1. The `kafka` output has been somewhat neglected since it was added 3 years ago. Additionally it brings a lot of complexity and isn't well understood by anyone on the team. Given that output extensions are possible since the last version, [the kafka output has been moved to one](https://github.com/k6io/xk6-output-kafka). The built-in output will continue to work for a few more k6 versions, emitting a deprecation warning when used, so that everyone has time to transition to the extension. All future improvements will happen only in the extension, the built-in output is frozen until it's dropped.
2. We are also deprecating/renaming the `datadog` output. It should've probably always been just a configuration of the `statsd` output and now in k6 v0.32.0, it is going to be just that. We've added a new `K6_STATSD_ENABLE_TAGS` option to the `statsd` output, which, when enabled (it's `false` by default), will send metric tags the same way the `datadog` output did before. That is, instead of using the `datadog` output, you should use the `statsd` one with `K6_STATSD_ENABLE_TAGS=true`. Additionally, the new `K6_STATSD_TAG_BLOCKLIST` option can be used to *not* send tags that the user doesn't want to, similar to the old `K6_DATADOG_TAG_BLACKLIST` option.
This makes it cleaner to also emit metrics to other services that accept the same data and tag formats, such as New Relic, Amazon Cloudwatch, and statsd >v0.9.0. The old `datadog` output will still work for a few k6 versions, emitting a warning to switch to `statsd` when used.

Apart from a message about them being deprecated, nothing should be changed from the actual refactoring yet, but we advise users to use the proposed alternatives starting with this release.

#### `json` output emits thresholds defined on the metrics ([#1886](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1886))

Previous to this change [thresholds](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds/) were not included in the `json` output. Now the `Metric` JSON object will get its `thresholds` field properly populated.

#### `cloud` output has an option to abort the test if aborted from the cloud ([#1965](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1965))

In v0.26.0 we made the cloud output [stop emitting metrics](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1130) if it gets a particular error from the backend, as that meant that the test was aborted in the cloud. Now we added `K6_CLOUD_ABORT_ON_ERROR` to be able to say that it should not only stop emitting metrics, but also stop the execution of local k6 test run. The default configuration is `false`, so it is backwards compatible. This also works when the test is aborted by the user or if cloud execution limits are reached, which would also lead to the test being aborted.


### Full stack traces for init context and setup/teardown exceptions ([#1971](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1971))

For a long time, if there was an exception in either the init context or in the `setup()` or `teardown()` invocations, the stack trace would be just the last line, making it really hard to debug issues there. Now there is a full stack trace and, as such errors will result in aborted k6 execution, `k6 run` will also exit with exit code `107`, signalling a script error.


### Considerable performance improvements for arrival rate executors ([#1955](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1955))

Due to a *wrong* re-usage for a particular internal data structure, the arrival rate executors were having a much worse performance than expected. With this release they should be a lot more performant, especially with large numbers of VUs.


### Updating the majority of our dependencies and dropping some

The list is too long and we have been postponing updating for quite some time now, but we have finally updated all our dependencies that we don't want to drop. This could lead to some stability problems, which is why it was done early on in the cycle. While the team has not found any regressions, given all the updates we could have missed something so please [open a issue](https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues) if you find anything.

Some notable updates:
- goja, the JS engine we use got support for `let`/`const` which let us disable a Babel plugin. Previous to this if you had a particularly *long* script sometimes Babel took upwards of 30 minutes to transpile. Now even our worst contender that previously took 51 minutes is transpiled in less than a minute :tada:. Also `globalThis` is now available.
- updating the gRPC libraries fixed bug [#1928](https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues/1928) and probably others. [#1937](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1937)

### `ArrayBuffer` is now supported in all JS APIs dealing with binary data, including in WebSocket messages ([#1841](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1841))

Besides the minor breaking changes (see the "Breaking changes" section below), it's now possible to send binary WS messages with the `socket.sendBinary()` function and to receive binary messages with the `binaryMessage` event handler:

  ```javascript
  const binFile = open('./file.pdf', 'b');

  export default function () {
    ws.connect('http://wshost/', function(socket) {
      socket.on('open', function() {
        socket.sendBinary(binFile);
      });

      socket.on('binaryMessage', function(msg) {
        // msg is an ArrayBuffer, so we can wrap it in a typed array directly.
        new Uint8Array(msg);
      });
    });
  }
  ```

### Official releases arm64 for MacOS and Linux ([#2000](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/2000))

We will now publish binary arm64 releases for MacOS and Linux for new k6 releases. Support for these new architectures should be stable, given Go's cross-platform compatibility, but please report any issues you experience.

## Other enhancements and UX improvements

- Options: k6 will now warn you on unrecognised configuration JS options in most cases instead of just silently ignoring them. ([#1919](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1919))
- error_code: the tag `error_code` should now be set more accurately in some cases. [#1952](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1951)

## Bugs fixed!

- Arrival-rate executors could in some cases report twice as many used VUs than what was actually true. [#1954](https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues/1954) fixed by [#1955](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1955)
- In cases of an error while reading the response body, the newly added `responseCallback` in v0.31.0 would be evaluated with the returned status code, while the reported one would be `0`, as the response errored out and k6 does not return incomplete responses. Now `responseCallback` will also receive a `0` status. ([#1962](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1962))
- Fix Kafka output not being usable with the InfluxDB format after v0.31.0 changes. [#1914](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1914)
- Error out with a user friendly message if `ramping-vus` executor would've not run a single iteration instead of just doing nothing. [#1942](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1942)

## Internals

- JS: Added a way for JS modules to have per VU initialization and object. This can also be used by xk6 modules by implementing `github.com/loadimpact/k6/js/modules#HasModuleInstancePerVU`. (Part of [#1911](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1911))


## Breaking changes

### Support for `ArrayBuffer` in all k6 JS APIs ([#1841](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1841))

Continuing from k6 [v0.31.0](https://github.com/k6io/k6/releases/tag/v0.31.0), we're finalizing the transition to `ArrayBuffer` values for working with binary data. This release introduces some changes that might break scripts that relied on the previous `array of integers` or `string` result types, returned by some of our JS APIs. Specifically these cases now return `ArrayBuffer` instead: `open(..., 'b')`, HTTP response bodies for requests that specified `responseType: 'binary'` (including when `http.batch()` is used), `crypto.randomBytes()`, `hasher.digest('binary')` and `encoding.b64decode()`.
  The previous default behavior of returning string from `encoding.b64decode()` can be replicated with a new optional `format` argument and a value of `"s"`: `encoding.b64decode("5bCP6aO85by-Li4=", "url", "s")`.
  Most of these shouldn't cause issues if the script is simply passing the values to another k6 API (e.g. opening a file as binary and passing it to `http.post()`), but in other cases the script will need to be modified to wrap the `ArrayBuffer` in a [typed array view](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) and use that API instead.
  

### Deprecating official 32-bit binary releases ([#2000](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/2000))

We have stopped offering official builds for 32-bit Windows and Linux binaries. 

### Moved repo and renamed k6 Go module paths to `go.k6.io/k6` ([#2010](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/2010))

We moved the repository location from https://github.com/loadimpact/k6 to https://github.com/k6io/k6. Instead of also moving the Go module paths to the new repo location, we decided to use custom ones with our own domain, for more control. This will be a breaking change for all [xk6](https://github.com/k6io/xk6) extensions, since they imports parts of k6 by source to register themselves.

### New `.deb` and `.rpm` repo

We already mentioned this in the [v0.31.0](https://github.com/k6io/k6/releases/tag/v0.31.0) release, but because of the Bintray shutdown, we had to move our `.deb` and `.rpm` repositories. They are now located at [dl.k6.io](https://dl.k6.io/), and you can use the updated [installation instructions](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) to transition to them.
