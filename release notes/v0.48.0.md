k6 v0.48.0 is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- Numerous long-awaited breaking changes.
- A new `k6 new` subcommand to generate a new test script.
- A new `k6/experimental/fs` module for file interactions.
- CPU and network throttling support for the k6 browser module.

## Breaking changes

This release contains several breaking changes. Most of them are just cleaning up deprecations from previous versions, and they should not heavily impact existing users and have a straightforward migration process.

- [#3448](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3448) limits metric names, aligning to both OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and Prometheus name requirements, while still being limited to 128 ASCII characters. Warnings about the limit started in [v0.45](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.45.0).
- [#3439](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3439) changes a `Client` signature in `k6/experimental/redis` module. See a module-related section below.
- [#3350](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3350) removes a `grpc.invoke()`'s parameter `headers`, deprecated in k6 [v0.37](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.37.0). Please use a `metadata` parameter instead.
- [#3389](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3389) removes `--logformat` flag, deprecated in [v0.38](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.38.0). Please use `--log-format` instead.
- [#3390](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3390) removes all CSV output's CLI arguments, deprecated in [v0.35](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.35.0). This change makes a CSV output consistent with other outputs.
- [#3365](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3365) removes a `k6 convert` CLI command, that was deprecated in k6 [v0.41](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.41.0). Please use a better alternative [har-to-k6](https://github.com/grafana/har-to-k6).
- [#3451](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3451) removes logic that was trying to prepend a `https://` scheme to module specifiers that were not recognized. This logic was deprecated in k6 [v0.25](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.25.0). Please use full URLs if you want to load remote modules.

## New features

### Add `k6 new` subcommand [#3394](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3394)

`k6` now has a `new` subcommand that can be used to generate a new test script. This is useful for new users who want to get started quickly, or for experienced users who want to save time when creating new test scripts. The subcommand can be used like this:

```bash
k6 new [filename]
```

If no filename is provided, the default filename `script.js` will be used. The subcommand will create a new file with the provided name in the current directory, and populate it with a basic test script that can be run with `k6 run`.

### Add a `k6/experimental/fs` module [#3165](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3165)

`k6` now has a new `k6/experimenal/fs` module providing a memory-efficient way to handle file interactions within your test scripts. It currently offers support for opening files, reading their content, seeking through it, and retrieving metadata about them.

Unlike the traditional [open](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/init-context/open/) function, which loads a file multiple times into memory, the filesystem module reduces memory usage by loading the file as little possible, and sharing the same memory space between all VUs. This approach signally reduces the memory footprint of your test script, and lets you load and process large files without running out of memory.

For more information, see to the [documentation of the module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/).

<details>
<summary> Expand to see an example of the new functionality.</summary>

This example shows the new module usage:

```javascript
import fs from 'k6/experimental/fs';

// k6 doesn't support async in the init context. We use a top-level async function for `await`.
//
// Each Virtual User gets its own `file` copy.
// So, operations like `seek` or `read` won't impact other VUs.
let file;
(async function () {
  file = await open('bonjour.txt');
})();

export default async function () {
  // About information about the file
  const fileinfo = await file.stat();
  if (fileinfo.name != 'bonjour.txt') {
    throw new Error('Unexpected file name');
  }

  const buffer = new Uint8Array(128);

  let totalBytesRead = 0;
  while (true) {
    // Read into the buffer
    const bytesRead = await file.read(buffer);
    if (bytesRead == null) {
      // EOF
      break;
    }

    // Do something useful with the content of the buffer
    totalBytesRead += bytesRead;

    // If bytesRead is less than the buffer size, we've read the whole file
    if (bytesRead < buffer.byteLength) {
      break;
    }
  }

  // Check that we read the expected number of bytes
  if (totalBytesRead != fileinfo.size) {
    throw new Error('Unexpected number of bytes read');
  }

  // Seek back to the beginning of the file
  await file.seek(0, SeekMode.Start);
}
```

### Redis (m)TLS support and new Client constructor options [#3439](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3439), [xk6-redis/#17](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-redis/pull/17)

In this release, the `k6/experimental/redis` module receives several important changes, including breaking updates.

#### Connection URLs

The `Client` constructor now supports connection URLs to configure connections to Redis servers or clusters. These URLs can be in the format `redis://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]` for standard connections, or `rediss://[[username][]:password@]][host][:port][/db-number]` for TLS-secured connections. For more details, see the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/redis/).

##### Example usage

```javascript
import redis from 'k6/experimental/redis';

const redisClient = new redis.Client('redis://someusername:somepassword@localhost:6379/0');
```

#### Revamped Options object

The `Client` constructor has been updated with a new [Options](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/redis/redis-options/) object format. This change aligns the module with familiar patterns from NodeJS and Deno libraries, offering enhanced flexibility and control over Redis connections. Detailed information is available in the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/redis/redis-options/).

<details>
<summary> Expand to see an example of the new functionality.</summary>

This example shows the usage of the new `Options` object:

```javascript
import redis from 'k6/experimental/redis';

const redisClient = new redis.Client({
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
  },
  username: 'someusername',
  password: 'somepassword',
});
```
</details>

#### (m)TLS support

The module now includes (m)TLS support, enhancing security for connections. This update also improves support for Redis clusters and sentinel modes (failover). For connections using self-signed certificates, enable k6's [insecureSkipTLSVerify](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#insecure-skip-tls-verify) option (set to `true`).

<details>
<summary> Expand to see an example of the new functionality.</summary>

This example shows the configuration of a TLS connection:

```javascript
import redis from 'k6/experimental/redis';

const redisClient = new redis.Client({
  socket: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
    tls: {
      ca: [open('ca.crt')],
      cert: open('client.crt'), // client certificate
      key: open('client.key'), // client private key
    },
  },
});
```
</details>

### Add tracing instrumentation [#3445](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3445)

`k6` now supports a new *traces output* option that allows to configure the output for traces generated during its execution. This option can be set through the `--traces-output` argument in `k6 run` command or by setting the `K6_TRACES_OUTPUT` environment variable.

Currently no traces are generated by `k6` itself, but this feature represents the first step towards richer tracing functionalities in `k6` and its extensions.

By default traces output is set to `none`, and currently the only supported output is `otel` which uses the [opentelemetry-go](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go)'s [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) API and SDK implementations. The format for the `otel` *traces output* configuration is the following:

```
--traces-output=<endpoint>[,opt1=val1,opt2=val2]
```
Where `opt`s can be one of the following options:
* `proto`: Specifies the protocol to use in the connection to the traces backend. Supports `grpc` *(default)* and `http`.
* `header.<header_name>`: Specifies an additional header to include in the connection to the traces backend.

Example:
```
K6_TRACES_OUTPUT=https://traces.k6.io/v1/traces,proto=http,header.Authorization=Bearer token
```

### Add support for browser module's `page.throttleCPU` [browser#1095](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1095)

Allows users to throttle the CPU from chrome/chromium's perspective, which helps emulate slower devices when testing the website's frontend. The mandatory argument is of type `CPUProfile`, which is made up of one field named `rate` that is a slow down factor, where `1` means no throttling, and `2` means 2x slowdown, and so on. The documentation for this API can be found [here](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/v0.48.x/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/page/throttlecpu).

```js
...
  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();

  try {
    page.throttleCPU({ rate: 4 });
...
```

### Add support for browser module's `page.throttleNetwork` [browser#1094](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1094)

Allows users to throttle the characteristics of the network from chrome/chromium's perspective, which helps emulate poor network connections when testing the website's frontend. The mandatory argument is of type `NetworkProfile` and is defined as:

```ts
export interface NetworkProfile {
    /*
     * Minimum latency from request sent to response headers received (ms).
     */
    latency: number;
    
    /*
     * Maximal aggregated download throughput (bytes/sec). -1 disables download
     * throttling.
     */
    download: number;
    
    /*
     * Maximal aggregated upload throughput (bytes/sec). -1 disables upload
     * throttling.
     */
    upload: number;
}
```

You can either define your own network profiles or use the ones we have defined by importing `networkProfiles` from the `browser` module. The documentation for this API can be found [here](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/v0.48.x/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/page/throttlenetwork).

```js
import { browser, networkProfiles } from 'k6/experimental/browser';
...
  const context = browser.newContext();
  const page = context.newPage();

  try {
    page.throttleNetwork(networkProfiles['Slow 3G']);
...
```

## UX improvements and enhancements

## Roadmap

### Graduating from experimental

It's been a while since we've introduced the `k6/experimental` namespace. It was meant to be a place for new features we wanted to test before committing to them. We've been able to iterate on features and get feedback from the community before committing to them.

In the following releases, we're going to graduate `k6/experimental/grpc` and `k6/experimental/timers`.

These modules' "experimental" versions remain available for a couple of releases, but the mid-term is to stick with the core only.
