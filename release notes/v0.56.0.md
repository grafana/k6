## New features

_optional intro here_

### Merge browser code in k6 codebase [#4056](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4056)

While the browser module has been stabilized, the codebase was not moved inside of k6.

As part of the stabilization this is now also merged in the k6 codebase. In the following months we would move issues from the [xk6-brwoser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) repo and then archive it.
