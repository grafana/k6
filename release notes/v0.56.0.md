k6 `v0.56.0` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- We've merged xk6-browser into k6.
- Many small improvements, bug fixes and internal refactors.

## Breaking changes

- [browser#1541](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1541) Removes `accessibility-events` from a test, which is no longer a valid permission that can be granted by the latest version of Chromium/Chrome.
- [#4093](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4093) Unexports `lib/consts.FullVersion` from the k6's Golang API.

## New features

### Merge browser code in k6 codebase [#4056](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4056)

While the browser module has been stabilized, the codebase was not moved inside of k6.

As part of the stabilization this is now also merged in the k6 codebase. In the following months we would move issues from the [xk6-browser](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser) repo and then archive it.

## UX improvements and enhancements

- [browser#1536](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1536) Removes `Headless` from the user agent to prevent test traffic from being blocked.
- [browser#1553](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1553) Reduces logging noise produced by the browser module.
- [#4093](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4093) Introduces a `--json` flag to a `k6 version` sub-command, which switches an output to a JSON format.
- [#4140](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4140) Tags browser module metrics with a `resource_type` tag which can be one of these values: `"Document"`, `"Stylesheet"`, `"Image"`, `"Media"`, `"Font"`, `"Script"`, `"TextTrack"`, `"XHR"`, `"Fetch"`, `"Prefetch"`, `"EventSource"`, `"WebSocket"`, `"Manifest"`, `"SignedExchange"`, `"Ping"`, `"CSPViolationReport"`, `"Preflight"`, `"Other"`, or `"Unknown"`.
- [#4092](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4092) Populates `__ENV.K6_CLOUDRUN_TEST_RUN_ID` with the corresponding value for local executions streaming results to the Cloud: `k6 cloud run --local-execution`.

## Roadmap

### Removal of deprecated `k6/experimental/browser` module

Since `v0.52.0` we have had a non experimental version of the browser module (`k6/browser`). We urge you to [migrate](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6-browser/migrating-to-k6-v0-52/) your scripts over to the non experimental browser module as we will be removing the experimental version of it in the next release (`v0.57.0`).
