k6 v0.40.0 is here! :tada: This release includes the promised experimental modules, some other small fixes and a lot of changes needed for the metric time series, unindexable tags and native ESM support. [Roadmap and future plans section](#roadmap-and-future-plans) makes another appearance with more info on how things are going and what should be expected

# New Features and notable changes!

## Breaking change!: Main module/script no longer taints the global scope [#2571](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2571)

As part of the ESM changes it was found out that anything defined in the scope of the main module also was accessible globally. This was because it was directly evaluated in the global scope.

This has now been remedied and is no longer the case. This is a *breaking* change, but given that the whole point of modules, CommonJS or ESM, is to separate modules - so this is obviously a bug.

We already have reports by people who have knowingly or not used it, but it seems fairly rare and contained to one or two usages in a script. The recommended way is to if you need something globally to set it explicitly on the global object `globalThis`.

## Experimental modules [#2630](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2630) and [#2656](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2656)

As mentioned in the v0.39.0 release notes, this release brings experimental modules. These are three modules bringing support for interaction with [redis](https://redis.io/), a new Websockets API that copies the "web" [Websockets API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) and [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) and friends as the third one.

The k6 team does not guarantee backwards compatibility for this modules and may change or completely remove them at any point. Also by the very nature of the import path, starting with `k6/experimental`, when they stop being experimental that will break user code. Of course we are going to try to limit those breaking changes to a minimum and when possible do them in backwards compatible way for at least a version.

### Redis example

Here is fairly big example showcasing using [xk6-redis](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-redis), but as an experimental module, to keep track of data in redis.

```javascript
import { check } from "k6";
import http from "k6/http";
import redis from "k6/experimental/redis"; // this will be `k6/x/redis` if you are using it as extension
import { textSummary } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-summary/0.0.1/index.js";

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    usingRedisData: {
      executor: "shared-iterations",
      vus: 10,
      iterations: 200,
      exec: "measureUsingRedisData",
    },
  },
};

// Instantiate a new redis client
const redisClient = new redis.Client({
  addrs: __ENV.REDIS_ADDRS.split(",") || new Array("localhost:6379"), // in the form of "host:port", separated by commas
  password: __ENV.REDIS_PASSWORD || "",
});

// Prepare an array of crocodile ids for later use
// in the context of the measureUsingRedisData function.
const crocodileIDs = new Array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);

export function setup() {
  redisClient.sadd("crocodile_ids", ...crocodileIDs);
}

export function measureUsingRedisData() {
  // Pick a random crocodile id from the dedicated redis set,
  // we have filled in setup().
  redisClient
    .srandmember("crocodile_ids")
    .then((randomID) => {
      const url = `https://test-api.k6.io/public/crocodiles/${randomID}`;
      const res = http.get(url);

      check(res, {
        "status is 200": (r) => r.status === 200,
        "content-type is application/json": (r) =>
          r.headers["Content-Type"] === "application/json",
      });

      return url;
    })
    .then((url) => redisClient.hincrby("k6_crocodile_fetched", url, 1));
}

export function teardown() {
  redisClient.del("crocodile_ids");
}

export function handleSummary(data) {
  redisClient
    .hgetall("k6_crocodile_fetched")
    .then((fetched) => Object.assign(data, { k6_crocodile_fetched: fetched }))
    .then((data) =>
      redisClient.set(`k6_report_${Date.now()}`, JSON.stringify(data))
    )
    .then(() => redisClient.del("k6_crocodile_fetched"));

  return {
    stdout: textSummary(data, { indent: "  ", enableColors: true }),
  };
}
```

This example also showcases how to write some data and clean up after yourself.

TODO maybe have a bunch of issues this can be used to solve ðŸ¤”

The extension does *not* run a redis server. All the infrastructure connected to and the actual running and scaling of redis needs to be handled separately.

You can see more example and documentation in the [repo](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-redis) of the extension is based on, as well as in the [official k6 documentation](https://k6.io/docsjavascript-api/k6-experimental-redis/).

### WebSockets example

This is a rewrite of the current WebSocket example at https://test-api.k6.io/.


This showcases how 1 VU can run multiple WebSockets connection asynchronously and how to stop them after a period using the `setTimeout` and friends.
```javascript
import { randomString, randomIntBetween } from "https://jslib.k6.io/k6-utils/1.1.0/index.js";
import { WebSocket } from "k6/experimental/websockets"
import { setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval } from "k6/experimental/timers"

let chatRoomName = 'publicRoom'; // choose your chat room name
let sessionDuration = randomIntBetween(5000, 60000); // user session between 5s and 1m


export default function() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    startWSWorker(i)
  }
}

function startWSWorker(id) {
  let url = `wss://test-api.k6.io/ws/crocochat/${chatRoomName}/`;
  let ws = new WebSocket(url);
  ws.addEventListener("open", () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({ 'event': 'SET_NAME', 'new_name': `Croc ${__VU}:${id}` }));

    ws.addEventListener("message", (e) => {
      let msg = JSON.parse(e.data);
      if (msg.event === 'CHAT_MSG') {
        console.log(`VU ${__VU}:${id} received: ${msg.user} says: ${msg.message}`)
      }
      else if (msg.event === 'ERROR') {
        console.error(`VU ${__VU}:${id} received:: ${msg.message}`)
      }
      else {
        console.log(`VU ${__VU}:${id} received unhandled message: ${msg.message}`)
      }
    })


    let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ 'event': 'SAY', 'message': `I'm saying ${randomString(5)}` }));
    }, randomIntBetween(2000, 8000)); // say something every 2-8seconds


    let timeout1id = setTimeout(function() {
      clearInterval(intervalId)
      console.log(`VU ${__VU}:${id}: ${sessionDuration}ms passed, leaving the chat`);
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({ 'event': 'LEAVE' }));
    }, sessionDuration);

    let timeout2id = setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(`Closing the socket forcefully 3s after graceful LEAVE`);
      ws.close();
    }, sessionDuration + 3000);

    ws.addEventListener("close", () => {
      clearTimeout(timeout1id);
      clearTimeout(timeout2id);
      console.log(`VU ${__VU}:${id}: disconnected`);
    })
  });
}
```

It is important to note that no k6 iterations do not finish if there is any WebSocket still open or if a timeout/interval is not cleared or triggered. This means that you need to be careful when writing the script to clear all interval and close the websocket in some point in time. K6 will still kill the whole process if it takes too long to stop after the maximum test duration is reached.

Current issues and future improvements for the WebSockets API can be found in it's [issue tracker](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets/issues). Currently documentation is available through [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) although some incompatibility apply:
- no Blob binary type - ArrayBuffer is the default
- no `onMessage` and co. - only addEventListener


## First class support for JavaScript Classes

As part of [updating goja](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2610) k6 got native, as in not by transpiling by the internal babel, support for classes ðŸŽ‰. Because this actually implements classes as they described in the latest ECMAScript specification this also means we get a ton of additional class features that were never previously supported such as private fields. Additionally at least one bug [#1763](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1763) was fixed as a result of this, but probably many more as well.

Due to this fairly big change there are chances that some code will now behave differently. Please report any issues, though take into consideration that it's possible that the new behavior is just the correct one.

Other updates from goja are:
- optimizations around using strings and some access patterns.
- support for `\u{01234}` unicode point syntax in regexp.
- fixes a case where interrupting the VM would not have worked, especially around try/catch usage. This was particularly problematic for k6 as this could lead to the whole k6 hanging forever. [#2600](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2600)

Many thanks to @dop251 for continuing to improve goja!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™‡

### New Test runtime for module extension developers [#2598](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2598)

While we are developing extensions internally it constantly comes up that you need to do create the same structure over and over again when you run stuff in tests. With the addition of the event loops it is now required to setup it as well. Even k6 team members get parts of this wrong every once in a while, so we decided to add a small type to be used by (extension) module developers to write tests easier. [#2602](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2602)

[This API](https://pkg.go.dev/go.k6.io/k6@v0.39.1-0.20220819115243-e09bb8727786/js/modulestest#Runtime) will likely change and evolve as we add more functionality or as we change the k6 internal API.

### `k6/ws` take `throw` option into consideration [#2247](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2247)

`k6/http` has been using the [`throw` option](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#throw) to figure out if should throw an exception on errors or whether it should return an response object with error set on it (and log it).

This functionality is finally also available for `k6/ws` which previous to this would've *always* thrown an exception making scripting around it more involved.[#2616](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2616)

This also is a small breaking change as by default `throw` is `false` so it will now no longer throw an exception, but instead now it will return a Response with `error` property.

Thank you @fatelei for making this change ðŸ™‡ðŸŽ‰!

# Breaking changes

- [#2632](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2632) As part of refactoring to set tags provided to `metric.add` in the order they are provided, it was found out that you can provide tags as multiple objects/maps. This has never been the intend use and has never been documented. As such and as that makes no sense given every other API we have decided to remove this ability.
- [#2571](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2571) Main module definitions no longer accessible globally. If need to use `globalThis` to set and access things globally.
- [#2582](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2582) If `RegisterCallback` result is called twice this will now lead to a panic, instead of the second call silently breaking the event loop. This has never been the expected behavior and calling it twice is always a bug in the code using it.
- As part of [#2596](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2596) the `tainted` property of the Metric type is no longer outputted by the JSON output. That property was (likely) always going to have the value `false` as it was outputted at the beginning of the test.
- [#2616](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2616) `throw` is now taking into consideration for `k6/ws` connections and will by default return a response object with `error` property instead of throwing an exception.


# Bug fixes

- [#2585](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2585) `http.batch()` now displays an error if not exactly 1 argument is given to it([#1289](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1289)). Thanks, @vanshaj!
- [#2596](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2596) Fix a potential data race in the JSON output. Includes a breaking change where `tainted` property is no longer outputted. That property was (likely) always going to have the value `false` as it was outputted at the beginning of the test.
- [#2604](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2604) Fix SSL keylogger not working with absolute paths.
- [#2637](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2637) Fix setting the options `rps` to `0` or below leading to exceptions. Now setting it to 0 or below disables the limit. Thanks, @tbourrely. [#2613](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2613)
- [#2278](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2278) Reading directly `options.tags` was not possible. This was fixed by accident by [#2631](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2631). It is still recommended that `k6/execution` is used instead to access the [final options of the test](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-execution/#get-test-options).
