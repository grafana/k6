k6 `<version>` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- (_optional_) `<highlight of breaking changes>`
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)


## Breaking changes

- `#pr`, `<small_break_1>`
- `#pr`, `<small_break_2>`

### StatsD output removed [`#3849`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3849)

The StatsD output was deprecated in k6 v0.47.0 and is now removed. You could still output results to StatsD using the xk6 extension [LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd](https://github.com/LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd). Thanks, @LeonAdato for taking over the extension!

## New features

_optional intro here_

### `<big_feature_1>` `#pr`

_what, why, and what this means for the user_

### Complete[^1] RSA support for `k6/experimental/webcrypto` [`#4025`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4025)

This update includes support for the RSA family of algorithms, including `RSA-OAEP`, `RSA-PSS` and `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5`. You can use these algorithms with the `crypto.subtle` API in the same way as the other algorithms, precisely for `generateKey`, `importKey`, `exportKey`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, and `verify` operations.

By implementing RSA support, we make our WebCrypto API implementation more complete and useful for a broader range of use cases.

[^1]: Since under the hood we do fully rely on the Golang's SDK, our implementation doesn't support zero salt lengths for the `RSA-PSS` `sign`/`verify` operations.

#### Example usage

<details>
<summary>Expand to see an example of generation RSA-PSS key pair.</summary>

```javascript
import { crypto } from "k6/experimental/webcrypto";

export default async function () {
  const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    {
      name: "RSA-PSS",
      modulusLength: 2048,
      publicExponent: new Uint8Array([1, 0, 1]),
      hash: { name: "SHA-1" },
    },
    true,
    ["sign", "verify"]
  );

  console.log(JSON.stringify(keyPair));
}
```

</details>

### `page.on('metric)` to group urls

Modern websites are complex, and perform a high number of requests to behave as the creators intended. Requests no longer just serve content that will be used for display to the end user, but also to retrieve valuable insights, analytics, serve adverts, and requests can be dynamically altered for cache busting purposes. Such requests are usually dynamically generated and may contain IDs that change often. This can be an issue when it comes to correlating and analyzing your k6 test results.

When it comes to load testing a website using the k6 browser module, such dynamic requests can result is a high number of similar looking requests which are hard to correlate and find any valuable insights in. This can also lead to tests erroring with a too-many-metrics error due to a high cardinality with metrics that are tagged with similar but dynamically changing URLs.

This is also an issue with synthetic tests, where you may not face the too-many-metrics message, but you will end up with a high number of uncorrelated metric data that can't be tracked over time.

To overcome this issue in the browser module, we have implemented `page.on('metric')` which allows you to define url patterns using regex to match against. When a match is found the `url` and `name` tags for the metric will be replaced by the new `name`.

#### Example usage

```js

import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
            type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

export default async function() {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Here we call page.on('metric). It's possible to call page.on('metric') more
  // than once, and the callback function will be executed in the order page.on
  // was called.
  page.on('metric', (metric) => {
    // At the moment metric.tag is the only method on the metric object. It is
    // the method that will match on the url tag with the defined regex pattern.
    // It can be called multiple times from within the callback function.
    metric.tag({
      // This is the new name that will be used for any metric which matches on
      // the existing url tag.
      name: 'test',
      // You can provide multiple matches here. Any metrics that match will all
      // use the new name defined above.
      matches: [
        // When a method is defined it will also need to match on that too. If a
        // method is not provided it will match on all method types.
        {url: /^https:\/\/test\.k6\.io\/\?q=[0-9a-z]+$/, method: 'GET'},
      ]
    });
  });

  try {
    // This is only for illustrative purposes, the q query param doesn't affect
    // the website.
    await page.goto('https://test.k6.io/?q=abc123');
    await page.goto('https://test.k6.io/?q=def456');
  } finally {
    await page.close();
  }
}

```

### `ControlOrMeta` support in the keyboard [browser#1457](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1457)

This will allow us to write the test for all platforms that either work with `Control` or `Meta` when performing keyboard actions. For example `control+click` on windows, and `meta+click` on mac to open a link in a new window.

#### Example usage

<details>
<summary>Expand to see an example usage of `ControlOrMeta`</summary>

```js
  await page.keyboard.down('ControlOrMeta');

  // Open the link in a new tab.
  // Wait for the new page to be created.
  const browserContext = browser.context();
  const [newTab] = await Promise.all([
    browserContext.waitForEvent('page'),
    await page.locator('a[href="/my_messages.php"]').click()
  ]);

  await page.keyboard.up('ControlOrMeta');
```

</details>

## UX improvements and enhancements

- [browser#1462](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1462) Enhance `waitForSelector` error message to better reflect why a selector doesn't resolve to an element.
- [#4028](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4028) adds support of SigV4 signing for the `experimental-prometheus-rw` output. This allows users to authenticate with AWS services that require SigV4 signing. Thanks, @obanby for the contribution!
- [#4026](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4026) allows setting of service.name from the `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable for the `experimental-opentelemetry` output. This aligns better with standard OTEL practices. Thanks, @TimotejKovacka for the contribution!
- [browser#1426](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1426) instruments `page.waitForTimeout` with tracing which will allow it to be displayed in the timeline.

## Bug fixes

- [browser#1452](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1452) fixes a possible deadlock when working with `page.on`.
- [browser#1469](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1469) fixes `locator.waitFor` so it waits between navigations and doesn't throw an error.
- [browser#1488](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1488), [browser#1493](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1493) fixes memory leaks.

## Maintenance and internal improvements

- [browser#1496](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1496) Add the `downloadsPath` option to specify the download directory. The browser module doesn't yet respect this option, but it will in the next release.
- [browser#1447](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1447) updates the CDP dependency.
- [browser#1281](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1281), [browser#1277](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1277), [browser#1275](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1275) removes Sobek out of business logic layers.
