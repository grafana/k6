### `<big_feature_1>` `#pr`

_what, why, and what this means for the user_

### Complete[^1] RSA support for `k6/experimental/webcrypto` `#4025`(https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4025)

This update includes support for the RSA family of algorithms, including `RSA-OAEP`, `RSA-PSS` and `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5`. You can use these algorithms with the `crypto.subtle` API in the same way as the other algorithms, precisely for `generateKey`, `importKey`, `exportKey`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, and `verify` operations.

By implementing RSA support, we make our WebCrypto API implementation more complete and useful for a broader range of use cases.

[^1]: Since under the hood we do fully rely on the Golang's SDK, our implementation doesn't support zero salt lengths for the `RSA-PSS` `sign`/`verify` operations.

#### Example usage

<details>
<summary>Expand to see an example of generation RSA-PSS key pair.</summary>

```javascript
import { crypto } from "k6/experimental/webcrypto";

export default async function () {
  const keyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(
    {
      name: "RSA-PSS",
      modulusLength: 2048,
      publicExponent: new Uint8Array([1, 0, 1]),
      hash: { name: "SHA-1" },
    },
    true,
    ["sign", "verify"]
  );

  console.log(JSON.stringify(keyPair));
}
```

- [browser#1473](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1473), [browser#1474](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1474), [browser#1477](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1477), [browser#1478](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1478), [browser#1475](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1475), [browser#1479](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1479) Generalize `page.on` event code to streamline the addition and running of additional events.
- [browser#1439](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1439) Update README to remove outdated information.
- [browser#1496](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1496) Add the `downloadsPath` option to specify the download directory. The browser module doesn't yet respect this option, but it will in the next release.
