k6 v0.44.0 is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- A new experimental webcrypto module.
- A sampling option for the tracing module.
- Support for z/OS Unix.
- A memory usage improvements.
- Bug fixes and UX improvements.

## New features

### xk6-webcrypto is now a built-in module [#2884](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3007)

This release includes [xk6-webcrypto](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto) as an experimental module. This is a work in progress implementation of the [WebCrypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) specification for k6.

The list of supported APIs and algorithms you could find in the project's [README](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/blob/v0.1.0/README.md#current-state)

### Compatibility with z/OS Unix [#2892](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2892)

k6 now supports running on z/OS Unix. This is a new platform that is not officially supported by Golang, but it is based on the same Unix kernel as Linux, so it should work fine. Thanks to @msradam for the contribution!

### Add sampling capabilities to the tracing module [#2886](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2886)

This release adds sampling capabilities to the tracing module. You can now specify a sampling rate with `sampling` option when initializing a Client or in `tracing.InstrumentHTTP` function.

### UX improvements and enhancements

- [#2906](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2906). Added multiple date-time formats other for CSV output. Thanks, @Azanul!
- [#2916](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2916). k6 started to show an actual binary's name in the usage help. Thanks, @ariasmn!
- [#2942](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2942). Reference 'k6 cloud' instead of 'Load Impact' in docs and errors.
- [#2985](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2985). Added support of async functions for `setup` and `handleSummary`.
- [#2901](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2901). Added a warning when the number of time series exceeds 100000, which could lead to potential out-of-memory issues.
- [#2997](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2997). Added a new exit code (`109`), which signals about go panic.

## Bug fixes

- [#2984](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2984). Fixed wrongly assigned HTTP `POST` and `PUT` methods for the `tracing.instrumentHTTP`. Thanks, @marcin-maciej-seweryn!
- [#2928](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2928). Handled a new behavior of `filepath.Join` on windows go1.20, which could cause issues for the `k6 archive` command.
- [#2915](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2915). Fixed `check` that could return incorrect values for some cases with many preallocated VUs.
- [#2953](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2953). Fixed active VU reporting by arrival-rate executors.
- [#2833](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2833). Fixed detected memory leaks.
- [#3006](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3006). `xk6-websockets` updated to v0.2.0 which fixes a memory leak.

## Maintenance and internal improvements

- [#2879](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2879). Improved the per-VU buffer pool which should reduce memory usage and improve performance. Thanks, @davidpst!
- [#3004](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3004). Changed `eventloop.WaitOnRegistered` to execute all scheduled callbacks.
- [#2881](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2881). Refactored how modules are loaded. This is a preparation for the upcoming ESM support.

- [#2999](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2999). Directly embed lib.TestPreInitState in js/common.InitEnvironment.
