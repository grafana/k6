### Introduction of `k6/experimental/streams` module #3696

This release of k6 introduces the new `k6/experimental/streams` module, which partially supports the JavaScript
Streams API, focusing initially on the `ReadableStream` construct.

With the `ReadableStream`, users can define and consume data streams within k6 scripts. This is particularly useful for
efficiently handling large datasets or for processing data sequentially in a controlled flow.

#### Limitations

This initial implementation is an experimental feature and does not include support for the whole Streams API feature set. 

Currently, users can define and consume readable streams . However, this release does not include support for byte readers
and controllers, nor does it include support the `tee`, `pipeTo`, and
`pipeThrough` methods of the `ReadableStream` object.

#### Example: streaming numbers 

The following example demonstrates creating and consuming a simple stream that emits numbers until it reaches a predfined
limit:

```javascript
import { ReadableStream } from 'k6/experimental/streams'
import { setTimeout } from 'k6/timers'

function numbersStream() {
    let currentNumber = 0

	return new ReadableStream({
		start(controller) {
			const fn = () => {
				if (currentNumber < 5) {
					controller.enqueue(++currentNumber)
					setTimeout(fn, 1000)
					return;
				}

				controller.close()
			}
			setTimeout(fn, 1000)
		},
	})
}

export default async function () {
	const stream = numbersStream()
	const reader = stream.getReader()

	while (true) {
		const { done, value } = await reader.read()
		if (done) break
		console.log(`received number ${value} from stream`)
	}

	console.log('we are done')
}
```
