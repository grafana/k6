k6 v0.42.0 is here and it brings a few exciting updates! :tada:

## New Features

### Experimental Prometheus Remote Write Output [#2784](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2784)

This release brings a new builtin Output to any [Prometheus Remote Write](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPhVRSFkGNSuU1fBd81ulhsCPR4hkSZyyBj1SZ8fWOM/edit) implementations (e.g. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#remote-write-receiver), [Mimir](https://grafana.com/docs/mimir/latest/operators-guide/reference-http-api/#remote-write)). This is an experimental feature, and future releases could introduce breaking changes.

The following example uses `k6 run` with the new output. It uses the defaults options, such as the Remote Write server URL (http://localhost:9090/api/v1/write):

```sh
k6 run -o experimental-prometheus-rw script.js
```

It supports the new and convenient experimental [Native Histogram](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/histograms) feature recently added in Prometheus >= `v2.40.0`. It is not enabled by default but we expect to make it the default way for mapping k6's [Trend metrics](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-metrics/trend) when it is marked as mature enough from the Prometheus' project and supported by more Remote Write's implementation. For now, a specific option allows to enable it, setting `K6_PROMETHEUS_RW_TREND_AS_NATIVE_HISTOGRAM` equals `true`.

You can find [complete documentation](https://k6.io/docs/results-output/real-time/prometheus-rw) with more examples, use cases, and available configurations.

### More features for the experimental websockets module [#2786](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2786) 

The `k6/experimental/websockets` module that we announced in [v0.40.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/tag/v0.40.0) release got an update that extends its functionality.

It brings some useful features that `k6/ws` module has, like cookies, custom headers, compression and tags customization support, and the additional syntax of defining the event handlers (`onopen`, `onmessage`, etc) and `ping`/`pong` functionality.

<details>
<summary> Expand to see an example of the new WebSockets functionality</summary>

This example customizes tags for a WebScoket connection, sets up handlers using the new `on*` syntax, and demonstrates a `ping`/`pong` feature.

```javascript
import { WebSocket } from "k6/experimental/websockets"
import { setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, clearInterval } from "k6/experimental/timers"

const CLOSED_STATE = 3

export default function () {
    var url = "ws://localhost:10000";
    var params = { "tags": { "my_tag": "hello" } };

    let ws = new WebSocket(url, null, params)
    
    ws.onopen = () => {
        console.log('connected')
        ws.send(Date.now().toString())        
    }

    let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        ws.ping();
        console.log("Pinging every 1 sec (setInterval test)")
    }, 1000);

    let timeout1id = setTimeout(function () {
        console.log('2 seconds passed, closing the socket')
        clearInterval(intervalId)
        ws.close()
        
    }, 2000);

    ws.onclose = () => {
        clearTimeout(timeout1id);

        console.log('disconnected')
    }

    
    ws.onping = () => {
        console.log("PING!")
    }

    ws.onpong = () => {
        console.log("PONG!")
    }

    // Multiple event handlers on the same event
    ws.addEventListener("pong", () => {
        console.log("OTHER PONG!")
    })

    ws.onmessage = (m) => {
        let parsed = parseInt(m.data, 10)
        if (Number.isNaN(parsed)) {
            console.log('Not a number received: ', m.data)

            return
        }

        console.log(`Roundtrip time: ${Date.now() - parsed} ms`);        

        let timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {
            if (ws.readyState == CLOSED_STATE) {
                console.log("Socket closed, not sending anything");

                clearTimeout(timeoutId);
                return;
            }

            ws.send(Date.now().toString())
        }, 500);
    }   

    ws.onerror = (e) => {
        if (e.error != "websocket: close sent") {
            console.log('An unexpected error occurred: ', e.error);
        }
    };  
};
```

The [module docs](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-experimental/websockets) have a complete reference, and some examples.

### Wildcard support for `hosts` option [#2747](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2747)

Thanks to the great effort from @eugercek, the [hosts](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#hosts) option now accepts domains that contain a wildcard.

```js
export const options = {
  hosts: {
    '*.k6.io': '1.2.3.4',
  },
}
```

### Enhancements, and UX improvements

- [#2660](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2660) Pre-loads the operating system TLS certificates. Thanks, @tbourrely.
- [#2773](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2773) Ensures that JavaScript runtime makes only one copy of the exports for each module including built-in ones.
- [#2791](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2791) Initializes VUs for `setup()` and `teardown()` only if they are defined in the script.

## Breaking changes

- [#2712](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2712) `k6/ws` returns an HTTP response for failed connections instead of an undefined behavior. Thanks, @brietaylor.

## Bug fixes

- [#2759](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2759) Ensures the evaluation of thresholds over trend metrics' median.
- [#2759](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2789) Fixes a few potential Output data races for interrupted test runs.
- [#2767](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2767) Fixes the emission of `ws_session_duration` when setup throws an error.
