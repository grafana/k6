## Breaking changes

### Require is now specification compliant and always resolve based on the file it is written in [#3534](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3534)

`require` in k6 used to resolve identifiers based on the current "root of execution" (more on that later). In a lot of cases that aligns with the file the `require` is written in or a file in the same folder, which leads to the same result. In a small subset of cases, this isn't the case.

Every other implementation and more or less by the CommonJS specification - require should always be relative to the file it is written in.

This also aligns with how ESM and dynamic `import` also work. In order to align with them `require` now uses the same underlying implementation.

There was a warning message for the last 2 releases trying to tease out cases where that would be problematic.

<details>
  <summary>"root of exeuction" explanation</summary>
This is very much an implementation detail that has leaked and likely a not intended one.

Whenever a file is `require`-ed it become the "root of execution" and both `require` and `open` become relative to it. Once the `require` finishes, the previous "root of execution" gets restored. During not init context execution, the main file is the "root of execution".

Example:

Have 3 files:
main.js
```javascript
const s = require("./A/a.js")
if (s() != 5) {
	throw "Bad"
}
module.exports.default = () =>{} // just for k6 to not error
```

/A/a.js:
```javascript
module.exports =  function () {
  return require("./b.js");
}
```
/A/b.js
```javascript
module.exports = 5
```
In this example when `require` is called in `/A/a.js` the `main.js` is once again the "root of execution". If you call the function in `/A/a.js` just after defining it though, it will work as expected.

</details

In order to facilitate being able to write helpers that use `require` (or [dynamic import](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3859) and `open` in the future) there is currently [a proposal](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3856) to add `import.meta.resolve` to k6.

### ECMAScript Modules(ESM) Native Support related breaking changes:

As part of the implementation, two common patterns broken in the ecosystem became apparent.

One is arguably a developer experience improvement, and the other is a consequence of the previous implementation.

#### Mixing CommonJS and ESM

Previously, k6 used a transpiler (Babel) internally to transpile ESM syntax to CommonJS. That led to all code always being CommonJS, and if you had CommonJS next to it, Babel would not complain.

As k6 (or the underlying JS VM implementation) did not understand ESM in itself and that CommonJS is a 100% during execution feature, this was not easy to detect or prevent.

We added a  [warning](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3807) in v0.52.0 to give users time for migration.

To fix this - all you need is to stick to either CommonJS or ESM within each file.

<details>
  <summary>Code examples and proposed changes</summary>

```javascript
import { sleep } from "k6";

module.exports.default = func() { ...}
```

In the example above both ESM and CommonJS are used in the same file.

Either replace
```javascript
module.exports.default = func() {}
```

with the ESM syntax

```javascript
export default func() {}
```

or replace

```javascript
import { sleep } from "k6";
```
 with the CommonJS:

```javascript
const sleep = require("k6").sleep;
```

</details>

#### Imported identifier that can't be resolved are now errors

Previously to this if you were using the ESM syntax but imported identifier `foo` but the exporting file didn't export it - there will be no error.

bar.js:
```javascript
export const notfoo = 5;
```
main.js

```javascript
import { foo } from "./bar.js"
export default function () {
    foo.bar(); // throws exception here
}
```
It would not error out, but when it is accessed, there will be an exception as it will be `undefined`.

With native ESM support, that is an error as defined by the specification and will occur sooner.

This arguably improves UX/DX, but we have reports that some users have imports like this but do not use them. So, they wouldn't be getting exceptions, but they would now get errors.

The solution, in this case, is to stop importing the not exported identifiers.

### No more "magic" URL resolution

For a long time, k6 has supported special _magic_ URLs that aren't really that.

Those were URLs without a scheme, that:
1. started with `github.com` that if pasted in a browser will not open you the file. Their appeal was that you can more easily write them by hand if you know the path within a github repo.
2. started with `cdnjs.com` that if pasted in a browser will open an web page with all the versions of the library. The appeal here is that you will get the latest version.

Both of them had problems though.

The github ones seemed to have never be used by users, likely because you need to guess what the path should look like, and you can always just go get a real URL to the raw file.

While the cdnjs ones have some more usage, they are both a lot more complicated to support, as they require multiple requests to figure out what needs to be loaded. They also change over time. In addition the only known use at the moment is based on a very old example from an issue and it is even pointing to concrete, old version, of a library.

Given that this can be done with a normal URL, we have decided to drop support for this and have warned users for the last couple of versions.

### Deprecated `k6/experimental/tracing` in favor of a JavaScript implementation

`k6/experimental/tracing` is arguably not very well named, and there is good chances we would like to use the name for actual trace and span support within k6 in the future.

On top of that it can now be fully supported in js code, which is why [http-instrumentation-tempo
](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/jslib/http-instrumentation-tempo/) was created.

The JavaScript implementation is a drop-in replacement, so all you need to do is replace `k6/experimental/tracing` with `https://jslib.k6.io/http-instrumentation-tempo/1.0.0/index.js`.

The module is [planned to be removed in v0.55.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3855), planned for November 11th, 2024.

### Experimental websockets now require `binaryType` to be set to receive binary messages

As part of the stabilization of the `k6/experimental/websockets` we need to move the default value of `binaryType` to `blob`. It was previously `arraybuffer` and since the last version there was a warning that it needs to be set in order for binary messages to be received.

That warning is now an error.

In the future we will move the default value to `blob` and remove the error.

## New features

The new features include:
- Native ESM support, which also brings some quality of life JavaScript features
- Blob support in the experimental websockets module
- Experimental OpenTelemetry metrics output
- Consolidating cloud related commands and features under `k6 cloud`

### Native ESM support [#3456](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3456)

With this feature k6 is now ES6+ compliant natively. Which means (asterisk free) support for [the spread operator with object](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/824), [private class fields](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2887) and [optional chaining](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2168)

But also faster startup times, more consistent errors and easier addition of features as we now only need to add them to Sobek instead of also them being supported in the internal Babel.

<details>
  <summary>History of compatibility mode and ECMAScript specification compliance</summary>

Some history: More than 6 years go k6 started using core-js and babel to get ES6+ features. core-js is implementation of a lot of the types and their features such as [`String.prototype.matchAll`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAll) among other things, and Babel gets one piece of code that uses some syntax and returns a piece of code doing the same thing (mostly) but with different syntax. Usually with the idea of supporting newer syntax but returning code that can run on runtimes which only support old syntax.

This is great, but it means that:
1. For core-js each VU needs to run a bunch of JS code each initialization so it can polyfill everything that is missing
2. Babel needs to be parsed and loaded and then given files to transpile on each start.

Both of those aren't that big problems usually, but the runtime k6 uses is fairly fast, but isn't V8. What it lacks in speed it gets back in being easy to interact with from Go, the language k6 is written in.

But it means that now on each start it needs to do a bunch of work that adds up.

So long time ago for people who would want to not have to do this we added [compatibility-mode=base](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/1206). This allowed you to potentially not use this features and get a big speedup. Or use them outside of k6 and likely still get significant speed up if you cut down on it.

At the same time the author and maintainer of the JS runtime we used (goja) did implement a *big* portion of what we were missing from core-js and also Babel. After some experiments to cut down the core-js we import we ended up contributing back the remaining parts and dropping the whole library. Which lead to 5 times reduction of memory per VU for simple scripts. And even for fairly complicated ones.

With this in mind we did try to cut down Babel as well and contribute back the simpler things it was used for. This over the years lead to small pieces of what Babel did being moved to goja and then disabled in Babel. Some of those were just easy wins, some of those were things that had very bad pathological cases where using a particular syntax made transpilation times explode.

In all of that work there always were small (or not so small) breaking changes due to many factors - sometimes our new implementation was slightly wrong and we needed to fix, sometimes more than what was in the standard was enabled in core-js or Babel, sometimes hthe standard changed on those. And sometimes the implementation in Babel or core-js wasn't as full and didn't account for all corner cases.

ECMAScript Modules(ESM) is the last such feature that Babel was used for. It also happens to be likely the one *most* people used, due to the fact that it is the standard way to reuse code and import libraries.

While the work on this feature started over 2 years ago, it both depended on other features that weren't there yet, but also interacts with more or less every other feature that is part of the ECMAScript standard.

Along the way there were many internal refactors as well as additional tests to make certain we can be as backwards compatible as possible. But there also ended up being things that just weren't going to be compatible, like the listed breaking changes.

</details>

After ESM now being natively supported, compatibility-mode `base` vs `extended` has only 1 feature difference - aliasing `global` to `globalThis` to make it a bit more compatible with (old) Node.js. There is ongoing [discussion](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3864) if that as well should be removed.

For the purposes of having less intrusive changes and shipping this earlier a few things have not been implemented in k6. That includes top-level-await and dynamic import support. Both of them are likely to land in the next version.

### Blob support in the experimental websockets module [grafana/xk6-websockets#74](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets/pull/74)

// TODO

### Experimental OpenTelemetry Output [#3834](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3834)

This release introduces a new experimental output for OpenTelemetry. This allows users to send k6 metrics to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. More details and usage examples could be found in the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/real-time/opentelemetry/).

To output metrics to OpenTelemetry, use the `experimental-opentelemetry` output option:

```bash
 k6 run -o experimental-opentelemetry examples/script.js
```

If you have any feedback or issues, please let us know directly in [the extension repository](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/issues).

### Future breaking changes

#### Experimental browser module removal

In the previous release, the browser module graduated from experimental to stable. The `k6/experimental/browser` module will be removed in `v0.54.0`. To keep your scripts working you need to [migrate to the `k6/browser` module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6-browser/migrating-to-k6-v0-52/).

#### StatsD removal

In this release, we also fixed the version where we will remove the StatsD output. The StatsD output [is going to be removed in the `v0.55.0`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3849) release. If you are using the StatsD output, please consider migrating to the extension [LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd](https://github.com/LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd).
