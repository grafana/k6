### OpenTelemetry experimental output `#3834`

This release introduces a new experimental output for OpenTelemetry. This allows users to send k6 metrics to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. More details and usage examples could be found in the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/real-time/opentelemetry/).

To output metrics to OpenTelemetry, use the `experimental-opentelemetry` output option:

```bash
 k6 run -o experimental-opentelemetry examples/script.js
```

If you have any feedback or issues, please let us know directly in [the extension repository](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/issues).
