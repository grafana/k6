## Breaking changes

### ECMAScript Modules(ESM) Native Support related breaking changes:

As part of the implementation, two common patterns broken in the ecosystem became apparent.

One is arguably a developer experience improvement, and the other is a consequence of the previous implementation.

#### Mixing CommonJS and ESM

Previously, k6 used a transpiler (Babel) internally to transpile ESM syntax to CommonJS. That led to all code always being CommonJS, and if you had CommonJS next to it, Babel would not complain.

As k6 (or the underlying JS VM implementation) did not understand ESM in itself and that CommonJS is a 100% during execution feature, this was not easy to detect or prevent.

We added a  [warning](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3807) in v0.52.0 to give users time for migration.

To fix this - all you need is to stick to either CommonJS or ESM within each file.

<details>
  <summary>Code examples and proposed changes</summary>

```javascript
import { sleep } from "k6";

module.exports.default = func() { ...}
```

In the example above both ESM and CommonJS are used in the same file.

Either replace
```javascript
module.exports.default = func() {}
```

with the ESM syntax

```javascript
export default func() {}
```

or replace

```javascript
import { sleep } from "k6";
```
 with the CommonJS:

```javascript
const sleep = require("k6").sleep;
```

</details>
#### Imported identifier that can't be resolved are now errors

Previously to this if you were using the ESM syntax but imported identifier `foo` but the exporting file didn't export it - there will be no error.

bar.js:
```javascript
export const notfoo = 5;
```
main.js

```javascript
import { foo } from "./bar.js"
export default function () {
    foo.bar(); // throws exception here
}
```
It would not error out, but when it is accessed, there will be an exception as it will be `undefined`.

With native ESM support, that is an error as defined by the specification and will occur sooner.

This arguably improves UX/DX, but we have reports that some users have imports like this but do not use them. So, they wouldn't be getting exceptions, but they would now get errors.

The solution, in this case, is to stop importing the not exported identifiers.

### No more "magic" URL resolution

For a long time, k6 has supported special "magic" URLs that aren't really that.

Those were URLs without a scheme, that :
1. started with `github.com` that if pasted in a browser will not open you the file. Their appeal was that you can more easily write them by hand if you know the path within a github repo.
2. started with `cdnjs.com` that if pasted in a browser will open an web page with all the versions of the library. The appeal here is that you will get the latest version.

Both of them had problems though.

The github ones seemed to have never be used by users, likely because you need to guess what the path should look like, and you can always just go get a real URL to the raw file.

While the cdnjs ones have some more usage, they are both a lot more complicated to support, as they require multiple requests to figure out what needs to be loaded. They also change over time. In addition the only known use at the moment is based on a very old example from an issue and it is even pointing to concrete, old version, of a library.

Given that this can be done with a normal URL, we have decided to drop support for this and have warned users for the last couple of versions.

### Deprecated `k6/experimental/tracing` in favor of a JavaScript implementation

`k6/experimental/tracing` is arguably not very well named, and there is good chances we would like to use the name for actual trace and span support within k6 in the future.

On top of that it can now be fully supported in js code, which is why [http-instrumentation-tempo
](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/jslib/http-instrumentation-tempo/) was created.

The JavaScript implementation is a drop-in replacement, so all you need to do is replace `k6/experimental/tracing` with `https://jslib.k6.io/http-instrumentation-tempo/1.0.0/index.js`.

The module is [planned to be removed in v0.55.0](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3855), planned for November 11th, 2024.

### Experimental websockets now require `binaryType` to be set to receive binary messages

As part of the stabilization of the `k6/experimental/websockets` we need to move the default value of `binaryType` to `blob`. It was previously `arraybuffer` and since the last version there was a warning that it needs to be set in order for binary messages to be received.

That warning is now an error.

In the future we will move the default value to `blob` and remove the error.

## New features

The new features include:
- Native ESM support, which also brings some quality of life JavaScript features
- Blob support in the experimental websockets module.
- Experimental OpenTelemetry metrics output.
- Consolidating cloud related commands and features under `k6 cloud`

### Native ESM support [#3456](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3456)

TODO: expand, talk about additional JavaScript features now support, top-level-await, dynamic import, compatibility-mode history, performance improvements

### Blob support in the experimental websockets module [grafana/xk6-websockets#74](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets/pull/74)

// TODO

### Experimental OpenTelemetry Output [#3834](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3834)

This release introduces a new experimental output for OpenTelemetry. This allows users to send k6 metrics to any OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. More details and usage examples could be found in the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/real-time/opentelemetry/).

To output metrics to OpenTelemetry, use the `experimental-opentelemetry` output option:

```bash
 k6 run -o experimental-opentelemetry examples/script.js
```

If you have any feedback or issues, please let us know directly in [the extension repository](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/issues).

### Future breaking changes

#### Experimental browser module removal

In the previous release, the browser module graduated from experimental to stable. The `k6/experimental/browser` module will be removed in `v0.54.0`. To keep your scripts working you need to [migrate to the `k6/browser` module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6-browser/migrating-to-k6-v0-52/).

#### StatsD removal

In this release, we also fixed the version where we will remove the StatsD output. The StatsD output [is going to be removed in the `v0.55.0`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3849) release. If you are using the StatsD output, please consider migrating to the extension [LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd](https://github.com/LeonAdato/xk6-output-statsd).
