A minor release that fixes some of the issues in the v0.23.0 release.

## Bugs fixed!

* Cloud: Fixed the interaction between the environment variable and JSON-based configuration, and the Load Impact specific `env.loadimpact` JS options. Now only the `projectID`, `name` and `token` fields will be populated (without overriding other fields) when executing scripts with `k6 cloud`, and taken into account when sending metrics to Load Impact Insights with `k6 run -o cloud`. (#848, #871, #872)
* JS: Fixed a Babel transformation issue that caused closing brackets to sometimes be commented out. (#853)
* JS: Fixed environment variable propagation when executing script bundles. (#853)
* HAR converter: Fixed a panic due to a missing nil check. (#861)
* Cloud: Limit the amount of samples that k6 sends in a single package to the ingest by splitting them up. (#860)
* Metrics: Fix the incorrect tracing of some corner case HTTP requests that resulted in negative or hugely positive metric values. (#862)
