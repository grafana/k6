k6 v0.44.1 is a patch release that fixes a couple of packaging issues:
- [#3055](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3055) due to an oversight, the k6 package signing key in our RPM repository wasn't updated when its expiration date was extended last month.
- [#30xx](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3055) fixed building of Docker image due to a missing pinned `ca-certificates` version.

There are no functional changes in k6 compared to v0.44.0.
