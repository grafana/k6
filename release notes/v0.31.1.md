k6 v0.31.1 is a patch release with a single bugfix.

The bugfix is about the cloud output and the new `http_req_failed` metric in k6 v0.31.0. Due to additional state being used for its transport to the k6 cloud, and a misunderstanding of what a functional call from a library dependency does, the `http_req_failed` values were always set to `1`. This did not affect any other output or the end of test summary. ([#1908](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1908))
