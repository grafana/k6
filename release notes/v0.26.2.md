k6 v0.26.2 is a minor release that updates the used Go version for the Windows builds to Go 1.13.8. Due to an oversight, previous v0.26 k6 builds for Windows used an old Go version, while builds of other OSes used the correct one. This is meant to address an issue in the Go net/http package: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34285 .

There are no functional changes compared to v0.26.1.
