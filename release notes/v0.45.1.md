k6 v0.45.1 is a patch release that fixes the build process for extensions:

- [#3252](https://github.com/grafana/pull/3252), [#3253](https://github.com/grafana/pull/3253) Due to the deletion of the go.buf.build registry that is used by the Prometheus remote write output, the building process for extensions has been broken.

There are no functional changes in k6 compared to v0.45.0.
