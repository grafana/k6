k6 v1.3.0 is here 🎉! This release includes:

- Browser module gets:
  - `locator.locator`, `locator.contentFrame`, and `FrameLocator.locator` for powerful locator chaining and iframe handling.
  - `locator|frame|FrameLocator.getBy*` for targeting elements without relying on brittle CSS selectors.
  - `locator.filter` for filtering locators for more precise element targeting.
  - `locator.boundingBox` for retrieving element geometry.
  -  `page.waitForResponse` for waiting on specific HTTP responses.

## Deprecations

### A new summary mode `disabled` has been introduced to replace the "no summary" option [#5118](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5118)

The `--no-summary` flag and its corresponding environment variable `K6_NO_SUMMARY` have been deprecated in favor of
the new `disabled` summary mode. This change unifies the configuration experience for controlling the end-of-test summary.

You can now disable the end-of-test summary with either `--summary-mode=disabled` or `K6_SUMMARY_MODE=disabled`.

### The `legacy` summary mode has been deprecated [#5138](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5138)

The `legacy` summary mode was introduced in k6 v1.0, when the end-of-test summary was revamped with the addition of two
new modes: `compact` and `full`.

Its purpose was to ease the transition for users who relied heavily on the old summary format. 
However, we’ve now reached the point where it’s time to deprecate it. 

The plan is to fully remove it in k6 v2.0, so please migrate to either `compact` or `full` to ensure readiness for the 
next major release.

## New features

### `locator.locator` [#5073](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5073)

The [`locator.locator`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/locator/locator/) method allows you to define locators relative to a parent locator, enabling powerful locator chaining and nesting. This feature lets you create more precise element targeting by combining multiple selectors in a hierarchical manner.

```javascript
await page
  .locator('[data-testid="inventory"]')
  .locator('[data-item="apples"]')
  .locator('button.add')
  .click();
```

This nesting capability provides a more intuitive way to navigate complex DOM structures and serves as the foundation for other `locator` APIs in this release that require such hierarchical targeting.

### `locator.contentFrame` [#5075](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5075)

The browser module now supports [`locator.contentFrame()`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/locator/contentframe/), which returns a new type [`frameLocator`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/framelocator/). This method is essential for switching context from the parent page to iframe contents.

`frameLocator` types target iframe elements on the page and provide a gateway to interact with their contents. Unlike regular `locator`s that work within the current `frame` context, `frameLocator`s specifically target iframe elements and prepare them for content interaction.

This approach is essential for iframe interaction because:
- Iframes create separate DOM contexts that require special handling.
- Browsers enforce security boundaries between frames.
- Iframe content may load asynchronously and needs proper waiting.
- Using `elementHandle` for iframe interactions is error-prone and can lead to stale references, while `frameLocator` provide reliable, auto-retrying approaches.

Example usage:
```javascript
// Get iframe element and switch to its content frame
const iframeLocator = page.locator('iframe[name="payment-form"]');
const frame = await iframeLocator.contentFrame();
```

### `frameLocator.locator` [#5075](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5075)

We've also added [`frameLocator.locator`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/framelocator/locator/) which allows you to create `locator`s for elements inside an iframe. Once you've targeted an iframe with `page.contentFrame()`, you can use `.locator()` to find and interact with elements within that iframe's content with the `frameLocator` type.

Example usage:
```javascript
// Target an iframe and interact with elements inside it
const iframe = page.locator('iframe[name="checkout-frame"]').contentFrame();
await iframe.locator('input[name="card-number"]').fill('4111111111111111');
await iframe.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();
```

This functionality enables testing of complex web applications that use iframes for embedded content, payment processing, authentication widgets, and third-party integrations.

### `locator.boundingBox` [#5076](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5076)

The browser module now supports [`locator.boundingBox()`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/locator/boundingbox/), which returns the bounding box of an element as a rectangle with position and size information. This method provides essential geometric data about elements on the page, making it valuable for visual testing, and layout verification.

Using `locator.boundingBox()` is recommended over `elementHandle.boundingBox()` because locators have built-in auto-waiting and retry logic, making them more resilient to dynamic content and DOM changes. While element handles can become stale if the page updates, locators represent a live query that gets re-evaluated, ensuring more reliable test execution.

The method returns a rectangle object with `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` properties, or `null` if the element is not visible:

```javascript
// Get bounding box of an element
const submitButton = page.locator('button[type="submit"]');
const rect = await submitButton.boundingBox();
```

### Locator filtering [#5114](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5114), [#5150](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5150)

The browser module now supports filtering options for locators, allowing you to create more precise and reliable element selections. This enhancement improves the robustness of your tests by enabling you to target elements that contain or exclude specific text, reducing reliance on brittle CSS selectors. We'll continue to add other filtering options in future releases, such as filtering by child `locator`s.

[**`locator.filter()`**](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/locator/filter/) creates a new `locator` that matches only elements containing or excluding specified text.

```javascript
// Filter list items that contain specific text
const product2Item = page
  .locator('li')
  .filter({ hasText: 'Product 2' });

// Filter items that do NOT contain specific text using regex
const otherProducts = page
  .locator('li')
  .filter({ hasNotText: /Product 2/ });
```

It's also possible to filter locators during their creation with options.

**`page.locator(selector, options)`** creates page locators with optional text filtering:

```javascript
// Create locators with text filtering during creation
const submitButton = page.locator('button', { hasText: 'Submit Order' });
await submitButton.click();
```

**`frame.locator(selector, options)`** creates frame locators with optional text filtering:

```javascript
// Filter elements within frame context
const frame = page.mainFrame();
const input = frame.locator('input', { hasNotText: 'Disabled' });
```

**`locator.locator(selector, options)`** chains locators with optional text filtering:

```javascript
// Chain locators with filtering options
await page
  .locator('[data-testid="inventory"]')
  .locator('[data-item="apples"]', { hasText: 'Green' })
  .click();
```

**`frameLocator.locator(selector, options)`** create locators within iframe content with optional text filtering:

```javascript
// Filter elements within iframe content
const iframe = page.locator('iframe').contentFrame();
await iframe.locator('button', { hasText: 'Submit Payment' }).click();
```

### `frame.getBy*`, `locator.getBy*`, `frameLocator.getBy*` [#5105](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5105), [#5106](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5106), [#5135](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5135)

The browser module now supports all `getBy*` methods on `frame`, `locator`, and `frameLocator` types, expanding on the `page.getBy*` APIs introduced in v1.2.1. This enhancement provides consistent element targeting across all browser automation contexts, improving Playwright compatibility and offering more flexible testing workflows. The available methods on all types are:

- `getByRole()` - Find elements by ARIA role
- `getByText()` - Find elements by text content  
- `getByLabel()` - Find elements by associated label text
- `getByPlaceholder()` - Find elements by placeholder text
- `getByAltText()` - Find elements by alt text
- `getByTitle()` - Find elements by title attribute
- `getByTestId()` - Find elements by data-testid attribute

#### Examples across different types

```javascript
// Frame context
const frame = page.mainFrame();
await frame.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
await frame.getByLabel('Email').fill('user@example.com');

// Locator context (for scoped searches)
const form = page.locator('form.checkout');
await form.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Card number' }).fill('4111111111111111');
await form.getByTestId('submit-button').click();

// FrameLocator context (for iframe content)
const paymentFrame = page.locator('iframe').contentFrame();
await paymentFrame.getByLabel('Cardholder name').fill('John Doe');
await paymentFrame.getByRole('button', { name: 'Pay now' }).click();

// Chaining for precise targeting
await page
  .locator('.product-list')
  .getByText('Premium Plan')
  .getByRole('button', { name: 'Select' })
  .click();
```

This expansion makes k6 browser automation more versatile and aligns with modern testing practices where element targeting by semantic attributes (roles, labels, text) is preferred over fragile CSS and XPath selectors.

### `page.waitForResponse` [#5002](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5002)

The browser module now supports [`page.waitForResponse()`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/page/waitforresponse/), which allows you to wait for HTTP responses that match specific URL patterns during browser automation. This method is particularly valuable for testing scenarios where you need to ensure specific network requests complete before proceeding with test actions.

The method supports multiple URL pattern matching strategies:

```javascript
// Wait for exact URL match
await page.waitForResponse('https://api.example.com/data');

// Wait for regex pattern match
await page.waitForResponse(/\/api\/.*\.json$/);

// Use with Promise.all for coordinated actions
await Promise.all([
  page.waitForResponse('https://api.example.com/user-data'),
  page.click('button[data-testid="load-user-data"]')
]);
```

This complements the existing `waitForURL` method by focusing on HTTP responses rather than navigation events, providing more granular control over network-dependent test scenarios.

## Roadmap

### Deprecation of First Input Delay (FID) Web Vital

Following the official [web vitals guidance](https://web.dev/articles/fid), First Input Delay (FID) is no longer a Core Web Vital as of September 9, 2024, having been replaced by Interaction to Next Paint (INP). The k6 browser module already emits INP metrics, and we're planning to deprecate FID support to align with industry standards.

FID only measures the delay before the browser runs your event handler, so it ignores the time your code takes and the delay to paint the UI—often underestimating how slow an interaction feels. INP captures the full interaction latency (input delay + processing + next paint) across a page’s interactions, so it better reflects real user-perceived responsiveness and is replacing FID.

#### Planned timeline

- v1.4.x+: Deprecation warnings will appear in the terminal when FID metrics are used [#5179](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/5179).
- Grafana Cloud k6: Similar deprecation warnings will be shown in the cloud platform.
- v2.0: Complete removal of FID metric support.

#### Action required

If you're currently using FID in your test scripts for thresholds or relying on it in external integrations, you should migrate to using INP as soon as possible.

```javascript
// Instead of relying on FID
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // 'browser_web_vital_fid': ['p(95)<100'], // Deprecated
    'browser_web_vital_inp': ['p(95)<200'], // Use INP instead
  },
};
```

This change ensures k6 browser testing stays aligned with modern web performance best practices and Core Web Vitals standards.

### OpenTelemetry stabilization

We aim to stabilize OpenTelemetry's experimental metric output, promoting vendor neutrality for metric outputs. OpenTelemetry is becoming the standard protocol for metric format in observability. Our goal is to enable k6 users to utilize their preferred metric backend storage without any technological imposition.
