- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)

## Deprecations

- [`#5118`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5118), deprecates `--no-summary` in favor of `--summary-mode=disabled`
- [`#5138`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5138), deprecates `--summary mode=legacy`

## New features

### `locator.locator` [#5073](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5073)

The `locator.locator` method allows you to define locators relative to a parent locator, enabling powerful locator chaining and nesting. This feature lets you create more precise element targeting by combining multiple selectors in a hierarchical manner.

```javascript
await page
  .locator('[data-testid="inventory"]')
  .locator('[data-item="apples"]')
  .locator('button.add')
  .click();
```

This nesting capability provides a more intuitive way to navigate complex DOM structures and serves as the foundation for other `locator` APIs in this release that require such hierarchical targeting.

### `locator.contentFrame` [#5075](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5075)

The browser module now supports `locator.contentFrame()`, which returns a new type `frameLocator`. This method is essential for switching context from the parent page to iframe contents.

`frameLocator` types target iframe elements on the page and provide a gateway to interact with their contents. Unlike regular `locator`s that work within the current `frame` context, `frameLocator`s specifically target iframe elements and prepare them for content interaction.

This approach is essential for iframe interaction because:
- Iframes create separate DOM contexts that require special handling.
- Browsers enforce security boundaries between frames.
- Iframe content may load asynchronously and needs proper waiting.
- Using `elementHandle` for iframe interactions is error-prone and can lead to stale references, while `frameLocator` provide reliable, auto-retrying approaches.

Example usage:
```javascript
// Get iframe element and switch to its content frame
const iframeLocator = page.locator('iframe[name="payment-form"]');
const frame = await iframeLocator.contentFrame();
```

### `frameLocator.locator` [#5075](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5075)

We've also added `frameLocator.locator` which allows you to create `locator`s for elements inside an iframe. Once you've targeted an iframe with `page.contentFrame()`, you can use `.locator()` to find and interact with elements within that iframe's content with the `frameLocator` type.

Example usage:
```javascript
// Target an iframe and interact with elements inside it
const iframe = page.locator('iframe[name="checkout-frame"]').contentFrame();
await iframe.locator('input[name="card-number"]').fill('4111111111111111');
await iframe.locator('button[type="submit"]').click();
```

This functionality enables testing of complex web applications that use iframes for embedded content, payment processing, authentication widgets, and third-party integrations.

### `locator.boundingBox` [#5076](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5076)

The browser module now supports `locator.boundingBox()`, which returns the bounding box of an element as a rectangle with position and size information. This method provides essential geometric data about elements on the page, making it valuable for visual testing, and layout verification.

Using `locator.boundingBox()` is recommended over `elementHandle.boundingBox()` because locators have built-in auto-waiting and retry logic, making them more resilient to dynamic content and DOM changes. While element handles can become stale if the page updates, locators represent a live query that gets re-evaluated, ensuring more reliable test execution.

The method returns a rectangle object with `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` properties, or `null` if the element is not visible:

```javascript
// Get bounding box of an element
const submitButton = page.locator('button[type="submit"]');
const rect = await submitButton.boundingBox();
```

### `locator.filter` [#5114](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5114), [#5131](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5131)

_what, why, and what this means for the user_

### `page.waitForResponse` [#5002](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5002)

The browser module now supports `page.waitForResponse()`, which allows you to wait for HTTP responses that match specific URL patterns during browser automation. This method is particularly valuable for testing scenarios where you need to ensure specific network requests complete before proceeding with test actions.

The method supports multiple URL pattern matching strategies:

```javascript
// Wait for exact URL match
await page.waitForResponse('https://api.example.com/data');

// Wait for regex pattern match
await page.waitForResponse(/\/api\/.*\.json$/);

// Use with Promise.all for coordinated actions
await Promise.all([
  page.waitForResponse('https://api.example.com/user-data'),
  page.click('button[data-testid="load-user-data"]')
]);
```

This complements the existing `waitForURL` method by focusing on HTTP responses rather than navigation events, providing more granular control over network-dependent test scenarios.

### `frame.getBy*`, `locator.getBy*` [#5105](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5105), [#5106](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5106)

## Roadmap

### Deprecation of First Input Delay (FID) Web Vital

Following the official [web vitals guidance](https://web.dev/articles/fid), First Input Delay (FID) is no longer a Core Web Vital as of September 9, 2024, having been replaced by Interaction to Next Paint (INP). The k6 browser module already emits INP metrics, and we're planning to deprecate FID support to align with industry standards.

FID only measures the delay before the browser runs your event handler, so it ignores the time your code takes and the delay to paint the UIâ€”often underestimating how slow an interaction feels. INP captures the full interaction latency (input delay + processing + next paint) across a pageâ€™s interactions, so it better reflects real user-perceived responsiveness and is replacing FID.

#### Planned timeline

- v1.4.x+: Deprecation warnings will appear in the terminal when FID metrics are used [#5179](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/5179).
- Grafana Cloud k6: Similar deprecation warnings will be shown in the cloud platform.
- v2.0: Complete removal of FID metric support.

#### Action required

If you're currently using FID in your test scripts for thresholds or relying on it in external integrations, you should migrate to using INP as soon as possible.

```javascript
// Instead of relying on FID
export const options = {
  thresholds: {
    // 'browser_web_vital_fid': ['p(95)<100'], // Deprecated
    'browser_web_vital_inp': ['p(95)<200'], // Use INP instead
  },
};
```

This change ensures k6 browser testing stays aligned with modern web performance best practices and Core Web Vitals standards.
