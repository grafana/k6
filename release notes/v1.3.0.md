k6 v1.3.0 is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- Browser module gets `locator.locator`, `locator.contentFrame`, `locator.boundingBox`, `locator.filter`, `locator.getBy*`, `frame.getBy*`, `FrameLocator.locator`, `Framelocator.getBy*`, and `page.waitForResponse`.
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)

## Deprecations

- [`#5118`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5118), deprecates `--no-summary` in favor of `--summary-mode=disabled`
- [`#5138`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5138), deprecates `--summary mode=legacy`

## New features

### `locator.locator` [#5073](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/5073)

The `locator.locator` method allows you to define locators relative to a parent locator, enabling powerful locator chaining and nesting. This feature lets you create more precise element targeting by combining multiple selectors in a hierarchical manner.

```javascript
await page
  .locator('[data-testid="inventory"]')
  .locator('[data-item="apples"]')
  .locator('button.add')
  .click();
```

This nesting capability provides a more intuitive way to navigate complex DOM structures and serves as the foundation for other `locator` APIs in this release that require such hierarchical targeting.
