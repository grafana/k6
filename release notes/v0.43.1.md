k6 v0.43.1 is a patch release containing a few bugfixes:
- [#2926](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2926) fixed a panic in `setup()` code when `vu.iterationInScenario` from `k6/execution` was used.
- [#2934](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2934) fixed a wrongly printed internal output ID to the `stdout` UI.
- [#2938](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2938) fixed a synchronization bug that caused k6 to get stuck after the end-of-test summary when sending the usage report took more than 3s. Thanks for [reporting this](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2937), @ichasepucks!
