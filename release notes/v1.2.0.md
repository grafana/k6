k6 v1.2.0 is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- (_optional_) `<highlight of breaking changes>`
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)

## Breaking changes

- The experimental Open Telemetry and Prometheus outputs are now enforcing TLSv1.3. This should've been the default to begin with. It is not expected that anyone should be affected, apart from making it more secure for the metrics output to send messages.


## New features

_optional intro here_

### Binary Provisioning [#4921](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4921) [#4922](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4922) [#4811](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4811), [#4812](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4812), [#4958](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4958)

TODO


### Handling of NaN and Infinity float values in gRPC [#4631](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4631)

Previous to this change sending an argument that had float values of NaN or Infinity would've sent them as `null`. This now changed to be send as their string representation which is aligned with other gRPC APIs.

There are no changes required in the scripts.

This is also the first contribution by @ariasmn. Thank you @ariasmn for taking the time to make the PR and answer all our questions.

## UX improvements and enhancements

- [#4853](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4853) Do not report NaN percentages when there are no checks in the end of test summary. Thank you @Fernando-hub527 for the fix.
- [#4897](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4897) Support string-labels in `locator.selectOption` in the browser module.
- [#4898](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4898) Add support for `authority` pseudo header to the gRPC module. Thank you @Oursin for the changes.
- [#4916](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4916) Print errors more consistently and correctly.
- [#4917](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4917) Add the ability to specify the url to wait for in waitForNavigation.
- [#4918](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4918) Surface navigation errors from navigation events in the browser module.
- [#4919](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4919) `page.url()` now doesn't make a call to the browser but instead uses a cached version. Making it a lot faster and aligned with playwright.
- [#4932](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4932) Making it more clear that the requests were aborted in the browser module.
- [#4944](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4944) Add Prometheus metrics endpoint. Thank you @gouthamve.
