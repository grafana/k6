## New features

### New experimental CSV module for efficient CSV data handling [`#3743`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3743)

We’ve added a new experimental csv module to k6 for more efficient and convenient CSV parsing and streaming, addressing the limitations of preexisting JavaScript-based solutions like [papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/).

#### What is it?

The csv module offers two key features:

* `csv.parse()` **Function**: Parses an entire CSV file at once into a [SharedArray](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-data/sharedarray/), using Go-based processing to using Go-based processing for faster parsing and lower memory usage compared to JavaScript alternatives.
* `csv.Parser` **Class**: Provides a streaming parser to read CSV files line-by-line, minimizing memory consumption and offering more control over parsing through a stream-like API. This is ideal for scenarios where memory optimization or fine-grained control of the parsing process is crucial.

#### Benefits for Users 

* **Faster Parsing**: `csv.parse` bypasses most of the JavaScript runtime, offering significant speed improvements for large files.
* **Lower Memory Usage**: both solution support shared memory across virtual users (VUs) with the `fs.open` function.
* **Flexibility**: choose between full-file parsing with csv.parse() or memory-efficient streaming with csv.Parser.

#### Tradeoffs

* **`csv.Parse`**: Parses the entire file in the initialization phase of the test, which can increase startup time and memory usage for large files. Best suited for scenarios where performance is prioritized over memory consumption.
* **`csv.Parser`**: Reads the file line-by-line, making it more memory-efficient but potentially slower due to reading overhead for each line. Ideal for scenarios where memory usage is a concern or where fine-grained control over parsing is needed.
 
#### Example Usage

<summary> Expand to see an example of Parsing a full CSV file into a SharedArray.</summary>

```javascript
import { open } from 'k6/experimental/fs'
import csv from 'k6/experimental/csv'
import { scenario } from 'k6/execution'

export const options = {
    iterations: 10,
}

let file;
let csvRecords;
(async function () {
    file = await open('data.csv');

    // The `csv.parse` function consumes the entire file at once, and returns
    // the parsed records as a SharedArray object.
    csvRecords = await csv.parse(file, {delimiter: ','})
})();


export default async function() {
    // The csvRecords a SharedArray. Each element is a record from the CSV file, represented as an array
    // where each element is a field from the CSV record.
    //
    // Thus, `csvRecords[scenario.iterationInTest]` will give us the record for the current iteration.
    console.log(csvRecords[scenario.iterationInTest])
}
```

    parser = new csv.Parser(file);
})();

export default async function() {
    // The parser `next` method attempts to read the next row from the CSV file.
    //
    // It returns an iterator-like object with a `done` property that indicates whether
    // there are more rows to read, and a `value` property that contains the row fields
    // as an array.
    const {done, value} = await parser.next();
    if (done) {
        throw new Error("No more rows to read");
    }

    // We expect the `value` property to be an array of strings, where each string is a field
    // from the CSV record.
    console.log(done, value);
}
```
