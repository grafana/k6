### New `asObjects` option in `k6/experimental/csv` module [#4295](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4295)

The CSV module's parsing operations now support the `asObjects` option, which enables parsing CSV data into JavaScript objects instead of arrays of strings (the default behavior).

When `asObjects` is set to `true`, the module parses CSV data into objects where:
- Column names from the header row become object keys
- Column values become the corresponding object values
- An error is thrown if no header row exists or if options modify the parsing start point

With the option set to `true`, 

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import csv from 'k6/experimental/csv';

const csvData = csv.parse('data.csv', { asObjects: true });
```

the following CSV file:

```csv
name,age,city
John,30,New York
Jane,25,Los Angeles
```

will be parsed into the following JavaScript objects:

```js
[
  { name: 'John', age: '30', city: 'New York' },
  { name: 'Jane', age: '25', city: 'Los Angeles' },
]
```

See the [csv module's documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/csv/) for more information.
