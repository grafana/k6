k6 `v1.0.0-rc1` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This release marks a special, non-conventional milestone in the k6 software life-cycle, serving as a preview of the upcoming version 1.0.0.

The purpose of this release is to give the community a chance to test the new version, identify any potential issues, and test migrations of any parts affected by breaking changes. If you encounter any problems or have trouble with the migration, we encourage you to report them by creating an issue. Your feedback will help improve the final release. If no critical issues are reported, we plan to release the final v1.0.0 version in a couple of weeks.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of whatâ€™s new in this release:

- `k6/experimental/webcrypto` promoted to stable and available globally under `crypto`.
- A revamped end-of-test summary aiming to bring an easier way to understand test results.
- `k6/browser` provided an API for tracking network requests and responses.

## Breaking changes

- [#4541](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4541) Commas(`,`) are now supported in the values of `--tag` cli flag. This is a breaking change as previously a comma meant the start of a new set of tag-values. As comma is a valid symbol for the value of a tag this is necessary to have equivalency between different ways of setting tags. This still allows multiple tags to be set on the cli with multiple `--tag key=value` arguments.

### A revamped end-of-test summary aiming to bring an easier way to understand test results [#4089](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4089)

**TL;DR** This change is a breaking change because the data structure that [`handleSummary`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/end-of-test/custom-summary/) function receives,
has changed. So, existing custom summary handlers need to be adjusted accordingly to the new data structure. 
Meanwhile, `--summary-mode=legacy` can be used for backwards compatibility. 

Other than that, we offer no guarantees on how the summary looks like, and it might change on new releases again.

```

See above an example of how the revamped end-of-test summary looks like.
It aims to bring an easier way to understand test results, with some relevant changes to the previous version that include:
- A new format to summarize the results of the user-defined [Checks](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/checks/) and [Thresholds](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/thresholds/) results.
- Now metrics are split into different sections, making it easier to focus on what really matters.
- Up to three different ways of displaying the results, depending on the `--summary-mode` flag:
  - `compact` *(default)*: what you can see in the example above, with the most relevant information.
  - `full`: similar to `compact`, but also including a few more detailed metrics, 
and detailed results for each [group](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/tags-and-groups/#groups) and [scenario](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/scenarios/) defined in the test. 
  - `legacy`: the old summary format, for backwards compatibility.

### A new default path for the configuration file [#4301](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4301)

The configuration file generated when one of the commands between `k6 cloud login` and the deprecated `k6 login` is used, got a new default path. The new default path is `{USER_CONFIG_DIR}/k6/config.json`.
The path used on the previous versions is `{USER_CONFIG_DIR}/loadimpact/config.json`.

1. Run `k6 cloud login` or `k6 login` to automatically migrate the configuration file to the new location.
2. After, run `k6 cloud run` or `k6 run` to verify that the version is now fully functional and no related warning is emitted.

If a configuration file is already available under the old path, `k6` when one of the `login` commands is used, it copies the configuration file to the new default path. The old path remains available and it can continue to be used with the previous k6 versions.
If the old versions are not used anymore then consider to clean up manually the old path by deleting it.

The `run` commands search for the configuration file in the new default file, if thye don't find one then they tries to fallback on the old path, and they log a warning message suggesting to migrate it.

## New features

### Browser: Tracking network requests and responses [#4290](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4290), [#4296](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4296)

The [browser module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/) adds support for tracking network requests and responses. This feature is especially useful for validating certain aspects of the requests and responses to determine whether the test was successful. It can also be used to debug issues with the test script or the tested application. See the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/page/on/) for more information.

For example, to track all requests and responses made by a page, you can use the following script:

```javascript
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // registers a handler that logs all requests made by the page
  page.on('request', async request => console.log(request.url()));
  // registers a handler that logs all responses received by the page
  page.on('response', async response => console.log(response.url()));

  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  await page.close();
}
```

Output might look like this:

```bash
INFO[0000] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/                  source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/api/tools         source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/images/pizza.png  source=console
...
```

### `k6/experimental/webcrypto` promoted to stable and available globally under `crypto` [#4278](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4278)

With this release, the `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module is promoted to stable and available globally under `crypto`. So you don't need to import it anymore.

```javascript
export default function () {
  const myUUID = crypto.randomUUID();

  console.log(myUUID);
}
```

`k6/experimental/webcrypto` is deprecated and will be removed in `v1.1.0`.

### Support for custom templates in `k6 new` command [#4618](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4618)

The `k6 new` command now accepts a path to a file to use as a template for the new script. Templates use [Go templates syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#pkg-overview) and can include the following variables:

- `ScriptName`: The name of the new script.
- `ProjectID`: The ID of the Grafana Cloud project to use for the new script.

To generate a new script using a custom template, use the following command:

```sh
k6 new --template /path/to/my-template.js
```
### Secret Sources [#4514](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4514), [#4621](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4621), [#4637](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4637)

Now k6 has a way to get secrets from different sources with a way to extend that. Among other things this means that the values received from a secret source will be redacted from the logs. See the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/secret-source) for more information.

At this point the two implementations included are to read them from key-value file or from cli flags, are meant mostly for testing the feature.

It already has extension support that can be used to implement retrieving secrets from more secure sources.

In the future k6 will likely add additional implementations that are more production ready.

A small example where we log the secret directly, but also make a request and then log the whole response. In both cases the secrets are redacted from the logs.

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import secrets from 'k6/secrets';

export default async () => {
  const my_secret = await secrets.get('cool'); // get secret from a source with the provided identifier
  console.log(my_secret);
  const response = await http.asyncRequest("GET", "https://httpbin.org/get", null, {
    headers: {
      "Custom-Authentication": `Bearer ${await secrets.get("else")}`,
    }
  })
  console.log(response.body)
}
```

```shell
$ k6 run --secret-source=mock=cool="not cool secret",else="totally a secret" script.js
...
INFO[0000] ***SECRET_REDACTED***                         source=console
INFO[0031] {
  "args": {},
  "headers": {
    "Custom-Authentication": "Bearer ***SECRET_REDACTED***",
    "Host": "httpbin.org",
    "User-Agent": "k6/0.57.0 (https://k6.io/)",
    "X-Amzn-Trace-Id": "Root=1-67dd6691-18eeaf5d1782bf292da5037c"
  },
  "origin": "1.1.1.1",
  "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"
}  source=console
...
```
