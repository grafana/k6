k6 `v1.0.0-rc1` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- `k6/experimental/webcrypto` promoted to stable and avaliable globally under `crypto`.
- (_optional_) `<highlight of breaking changes>`
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)


## Breaking changes

- [#4541](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4541) Commas(`,`) are now supported in the values of `--tag` cli flag. This is a breaking change as previously a comma meant the start of a new set of tag-values. As comma is a valid symbol for the value of a tag this is necessary to have equivalency between different ways of setting tags. This still allows multiple tags to be set on the cli with multiple `--tag key=value` arguments.

### (_optional h3_) `<big_breaking_change>` `#pr`

### A new default path for the configuration file [#4301](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4301)

The configuration file generated when the commands `k6 cloud login` and the deprecated `k6 login` are used got a new default path. The new default path is `{USER_CONFIG_DIR}/k6/config.json`.
The path used on the previous versions is `{USER_CONFIG_DIR}/loadimpact/config.json`.

1. Run `k6 cloud login` or `k6 login` to automatically migrate the configuration file to the new location.
2. After, run `k6 cloud run` or `k6 run` to verify that the version is now fully functional and any related warning is emitted.

If a configuration file is already available under the old path, `k6` when one of the `login` commands is used, it copies the configuration file to the new default path. The old path remains available and it can continue to be used with the previous k6 versions.
If the old versions are not used anymore then consider to clean up manually the old path by deleting it.

The `run` commands search for the configuration file in the new default file, if thye don't find one then they tries to fallback on the old path, and they log a warning message suggesting to migrate it.

## New features

### Browser: Tracking network requests and responses [#4290](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4290) [#4296](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4296)

The [browser module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/) adds support for tracking network requests and responses. This feature is especially useful for validating certain aspects of the requests and responses to determine whether the test was successful. It can also be used to debug issues with the test script or the tested application. See the [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/page/on/) for more information.

For example, to track all requests and responses made by a page, you can use the following script:

```javascript
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // registers a handler that logs all requests made by the page
  page.on('request', async request => console.log(request.url()));
  // registers a handler that logs all responses received by the page
  page.on('response', async response => console.log(response.url()));

  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  await page.close();
}
```

Output might look like this:

```bash
INFO[0000] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/                  source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/api/tools         source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/images/pizza.png  source=console
...
```

### `k6/experimental/webcrypto` promoted to stable and avaliable globally under `crypto`. [#4278](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4278)

With this release, the `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module is promoted to stable and avaliable globally under `crypto`. So you don't need to import it anymore.

```javascript
export default function () {
  const myUUID = crypto.randomUUID();

  console.log(myUUID);
}
```

`k6/experimental/webcrypto` is deprecated and will be removed in `v1.1.0`.
