### Browser: Tracking network requests and responses [#4290](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4290) [#4296](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/4296)

The [browser module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser/) adds support for tracking network requests and responses. This feature is especially useful for validating certain aspects of the requests and responses to determine whether the test was successful. It can also be used to debug issues with the test script or the tested application.

For example, to track all requests and responses made by a page, you can use the following script:

```javascript
import { browser } from 'k6/browser';

export const options = {
  scenarios: {
    ui: {
      executor: 'shared-iterations',
      options: {
        browser: {
          type: 'chromium',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};

export default async function () {
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // registers a handler that logs all requests made by the page
  page.on('request', async request => console.log(request.url()));
  // registers a handler that logs all responses received by the page
  page.on('response', async response => console.log(response.url()));

  await page.goto('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/', { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
  await page.close();
}
```

Output might look like this:

```bash
INFO[0000] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/                  source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/api/tools         source=console
INFO[0001] https://quickpizza.grafana.com/images/pizza.png  source=console

```
