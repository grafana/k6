### Add gRPC's binary metadata support [#3234](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3234), [xk6-grpc#46](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-grpc/pull/46)

By specification gRPC metadata with the `-bin` postfix should be treated as binary data. These PRs add the support of such metadata to the `k6/net/grpc` and `k6/experimental/grpc` modules.

```js
let resp = client.invoke("grpc.testing.TestService/EmptyCall", {}, { metadata: { "X-Load-Tester-bin": new Uint8Array([2, 200]) } })
```

Thanks, @sapphire-janrain, for contribution!

### Add the reflection metadata [#3343](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3343), [xk6-grpc#46](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-grpc/pull/46)

In some workflows the reflection call should also include some metadata. This PR adds [a new connection parameter `reflectMetadata`](https://k6.io/docs/javascript-api/k6-net-grpc/client/client-connect/#connectparams) that allows to specify the metadata to be sent with the reflection call.

### Add support for browser module's `page.on('console')` [xk6-browser#1006](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1006)

Allows users to register a handler to be executed every time the `console` API methods are called from within the page JavaScript context.
