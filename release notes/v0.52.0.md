k6 `v0.52.0` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- (_optional_) `<highlight of breaking changes>`
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)


## Breaking changes

- [`#3777`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3777) removes panic handling in k6. Previously, k6 tried to recover and continue execution. Unfortunately, this isn't always successful and could lead to unexpected behavior. Now, k6 will always exit on panic. Panic itself should be fixed separately.
- `#pr`, `<small_break_2>`

### (_optional h3_) `<big_breaking_change>` `#pr`

## Roadmap

### OpenTelemetry metrics output

We're also happy to share that this release cycle, we've been working on [xk6-output-opentelemetry](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/), a k6 output extension that allows you to send k6 metrics to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. We're looking for feedback from the community. If you're interested, please try it and let us know [via the extension repository](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/issues)!

Depending on the feedback, we plan to include this extension as an experimental output in the next K6 release.
