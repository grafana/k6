## Breaking changes

### Switch `goja` to our own fork named `sobek` [#3775](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3775)

To accelerate the development speed and bring ECMAScript Modules (ESM) support to k6 earlier (https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3265),
we have decided to create a fork of the [`goja`](https://github.com/dop251/goja/) project under the Grafana GitHub organization,
named [`sobek`](https://github.com/grafana/sobek).

Starting on this release, k6 (and its extensions) now use `sobek` instead of the original `goja`, for all (of the
publicly exposed parts of the API) except for a couple of packages that are only used internally by k6.

All k6 extensions linked in the docs have had a PR for this transition opened, as explained in this [comment](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3773#issuecomment-2182113677). Any extension author who hasn't gotten a PR can follow the same steps.

Find further details in [#3772](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3772) and [#3773](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3773).

### Panics are no longer being captured [#3777](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3777)

Since this release, Go panics are no longer being captured by k6. This means that if a panic occurs while running a test,
the k6 process will crash, and the panic stack trace will be printed to the console.

We decided to change this behavior because it's something that was left from the past as a safeguard, but it's not as
good as it might seem. For most cases with multiple goroutines/async, it's not enough and also makes a bunch of potential
bugs seem like less of an issue.

Thus, this will help us to identify and fix bugs earlier, improve the overall stability of k6, and
most likely make the experience of developing k6 extensions friendlier.

### `lib.State` no longer has `Group` [#3750](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3750)

As the result of refactoring the implementation of `group` and `check` methods, in order to decouple them, and thus 
enable other future improvements, the `lib.State` object no longer has a `Group` field.

This change should not affect most users, except for a couple of extensions, for which the use of `Group` was
already questionable:
- `xk6-fasthttp`
- `xk6-g0`

### Other breaking changes

- [#3797](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3797) starts using `-` as a special value for `--archive-out` to output the archive to stdout.
- [browser#1318](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1318) makes the `Mouse.up` and `Mouse.down` methods no longer take x and y coordinates. Instead, they dispatch events on the current mouse position.

## New features

### Experimental support for TypeScript and ES6+ using esbuild [#3738](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3738)

This release of k6 introduces experimental support for TypeScript and ES6+ using esbuild, thanks to a new
[compatibility mode](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/javascript-typescript-compatibility-mode/) named `experimental_enhanced`.

```sh
k6 run --compatibility-mode=experimental_enhanced script.js
```

With this new compatibility mode, the test source code is transformed using esbuild instead of Babel, which also means
that source files with the extension _".ts"_ are loaded by esbuild's TypeScript loader, which results in partial 
TypeScript support: it removes the type information but doesn't provide type safety.

### `k6/browser` has graduated from an experimental module [#3793](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3793)

The browser module is now available as `k6/browser` instead of `k6/experimental/browser`. The previous `k6/experimental/browser` module will be removed on September 23rd, 2024. Refer to [the migration guide](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6-browser/migrating-to-k6-v0-52/) for more information on how to update your scripts.

### `k6/browser` has now a fully Async API [browser#428](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/428)

This release introduces a fully Async API for the `k6/browser` module. This means that nearly all the methods in the module now return promises. This change is part of the ongoing effort to make the browser module more user-friendly and easier to use. Please see [the browser documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-browser) for more information on how to use the new Async API.

## Roadmap

### Native ECMAScript modules

As mentioned above, the k6 team has forked [`goja`](https://github.com/dop251/goja/) into [`sobek`](https://github.com/grafana/sobek) and is currently working on [native ECMAScript modules support](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3265). The current work in progress can be found in this [PR](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3456) and any feedback is welcome.

As part of that there likely will be some breaking changes due to the current not native support allowing stuff that shouldn't work. Like for example mixing [CommonJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) and ESM in the same file. Which is for example why we have added a [warning](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3807) that it won't work. 

Support across multiple files is *also* not standard but due to amount of users that seems to be mixing them *across* files a lot of work has been done to support it. It is still likely that in the future warnings and potentially at some point future breaking changes will be enacted.

### OpenTelemetry metrics output

We're also happy to share that this release cycle, we've been working on [xk6-output-opentelemetry](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/results-output/real-time/opentelemetry/), a k6 output extension that allows you to send k6 metrics to OpenTelemetry-compatible backends. We're looking for feedback from the community. If you're interested, please try it and let us know [via the extension repository](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-output-opentelemetry/issues)!

Depending on the feedback, we plan to include this extension as an experimental output in the next k6 release.
