k6 `v0.52.0` is here ðŸŽ‰! This release includes:

- (_optional_) `<highlight of breaking changes>`
- `<Summary of new features>` (_one or multiple bullets_)


## Breaking changes

- [`#3777`](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3777) removes panic handling in k6. Previously, k6 tried to recover and continue execution. Unfortunately, this isn't always successful and could lead to unexpected behavior. Now, k6 will always exit on panic. Panic itself should be fixed separately.
