	// It contains both pre-initialized (i.e. planned) VUs, as well as any
	// unplanned VUs. Planned VUs are initialized before a test begins, while
	// unplanned VUS can be initialized in the middle of the test run by a
	// executor and have been relinquished after it has finished working with
	// them. Usually, unplanned VUs are initialized by one of the arrival-rate
	// executors, after they have exhausted their PreAllocatedVUs. After the
	// executor is done with the VUs, it will put in this channel, so it could

	// here than its execution plan has stipulated. The correctness guarantee
	// lies with the actual executors - bugs in one can affect others.
	//
	// That's why the field is private and we force executors to use the
	// GetPlannedVU(), GetUnplannedVU(), and ReturnVU() methods instead of work
