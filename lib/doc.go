// Package lib is a kitchen sink of... basically anything that doesn't belong in
// a specific part of the codebase, ranging from utility functions to universal
// types to core interfaces.
//
// Some of the things in lib do not actually belong in lib, and need to be moved
// into either submodules, or separate modules like core. Other things are in
// files that are far too long, or that do not actually make sense.
//
// Feel free to move these things.
