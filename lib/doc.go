// Package lib is a kitchen sink of... basically anything that doesn't belong in a specific part of
// the codebase, ranging from utility functions to universal types to core interfaces.
//
// Some of the things in lib do not actually belong in lib, most notably the Executor and Runner,
// which arguably belong in core. Other things are in files that are far too long, or that do not
// actually make sense.
//
// Feel free to move these things.
